"As usual, we have the deep-dive Coffee Lake coverage in our Core i7-8700K Review: Coffee Lake Brews A Great Gaming CPU review, but for those of you without the time to sift through all 13 pages, we've condensed all of our gaming results to give you a cheat sheet of sorts on Intel's new halo product.
Coffee Lake has arrived, and after nearly a decade of quad-core doldrums in Intel's mainstream desktop space, the company finally decided to bulk up its Core i7, i5, and i3 series. Intel added two more cores to each of the families and also increased the Turbo Boost frequencies to the highest an Intel chip has seen. Better yet, those increased resources come with a minimal price increase over the Kaby Lake models for the unlocked K-series chips, and the same price for the locked models. We can thank AMD for that.
We also have articles that compare Intel's full Coffee Lake lineup to Kaby Lake and a full breakdown of comparisons to AMD's beefy Ryzen stable.
And No, Coffee Lake will not run in Z270 motherboards.
So, if you whip out your wallet for Intel's six-core, 12-thread flagship and a new motherboard, what does that give you on the gaming front?

This. Our 99th percentile FPS chart provides a geometric mean of the results, converted into an FPS measurement, of all the games in our test suite. That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

But bleeding edge performance is only part of the equation. We demand good value--a point AMD drove home with its speedy Ryzen lineup. Intel has obviously taken note, and the additional cores comes without radical price increases. Overall, the Core i7-8700K represents a solid value for those who demand the ultimate in performance, and the lesser Core i5 and i3 SKUs also look promising for the more pragmatic among us.
The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year. Knowing this, should you upgrade now or wait for the next wave of hardware? Due to the iterative nature of most updates, we rarely recommend jumping forward one, or even two generations. However, if you routinely find yourself running productivity workloads that might be served well by Core i7-8700K's extra cores, we could see replacing a quad-core chip with six cores. Gamers interested in maximum performance or streaming also stand to benefit, though in a world of single-GPU graphics configurations, you'd be hard-pressed to bottleneck an overclocked -7700K with even a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (particularly at the high resolutions it's meant to drive).
The Core i7-8700K took home our Editor's Choice award. So feel free to take a dip in Coffee Lake if you've got the dosh--we doubt you'll be disappointed. We're working on testing the i5 and i3 models now, so stay tuned.",1.0769720077514648,0,1

Teigen also shared her skincare routine, which includes moisturizing regularly with oils and creams specifically designed for pregnant women. “I use a combination of coconut oil and a rich body butter to keep my skin hydrated,” she explained. 

While she acknowledges that genetics play a significant role in whether or not someone develops stretch marks, Teigen encourages others to focus on the beauty of their bodies rather than the imperfections. “Every mark tells a story,” she added.

"As usual, we have the deep-dive Coffee Lake coverage in our Core i7-8700K Review: Coffee Lake Brews A Great Gaming CPU review, but for those of you without the time to sift through all 13 pages, we've condensed all of our gaming results to give you a cheat sheet of sorts on Intel's new halo product.
Coffee Lake has arrived, and after nearly a decade of quad-core doldrums in Intel's mainstream desktop space, the company finally decided to bulk up its Core i7, i5, and i3 series. Intel added two more cores to each of the families and also increased the Turbo Boost frequencies to the highest an Intel chip has seen. Better yet, those increased resources come with a minimal price increase over the Kaby Lake models for the unlocked K-series chips, and the same price for the locked models. We can thank AMD for that.
We also have articles that compare Intel's full Coffee Lake lineup to Kaby Lake and a full breakdown of comparisons to AMD's beefy Ryzen stable.
And No, Coffee Lake will not run in Z270 motherboards.
So, if you whip out your wallet for Intel's six-core, 12-thread flagship and a new motherboard, what does that give you on the gaming front?

This. Our 99th percentile FPS chart provides a geometric mean of the results, converted into an FPS measurement, of all the games in our test suite. That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

But bleeding edge performance is only part of the equation. We demand good value--a point AMD drove home with its speedy Ryzen lineup. Intel has obviously taken note, and the additional cores comes without radical price increases. Overall, the Core i7-8700K represents a solid value for those who demand the ultimate in performance, and the lesser Core i5 and i3 SKUs also look promising for the more pragmatic among us.
The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year. Knowing this, should you upgrade now or wait for the next wave of hardware? Due to the iterative nature of most updates, we rarely recommend jumping forward one, or even two generations. However, if you routinely find yourself running productivity workloads that might be served well by Core i7-8700K's extra cores, we could see replacing a quad-core chip with six cores. Gamers interested in maximum performance or streaming also stand to benefit, though in a world of single-GPU graphics configurations, you'd be hard-pressed to bottleneck an overclocked -7700K with even a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (particularly at the high resolutions it's meant to drive).

"...the evangelical icon who passed away at the age of 99. Graham, known for his powerful sermons and global outreach, was honored in a ceremony that drew lawmakers from both parties, reflecting his impact on American society and politics. 

House Speaker Paul Ryan praised Graham as a ""spiritual adviser"" to presidents and a voice of hope for millions. ""He taught us that faith is not just a private matter but a public calling,"" Ryan said. 

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell echoed those sentiments, highlighting Graham's ability to unite people across different backgrounds. ""He showed us the power of love and forgiveness,"" McConnell stated. 

The service included readings from scripture and personal reflections from family members, who spoke of Graham's unwavering faith and commitment to spreading the message of Christ.

"...encouragement and inspiration. The tweet quickly gained traction, with users sharing their own favorite verses and adding humorous commentary. What began as a heartfelt message transformed into a lighthearted meme, with users creatively altering the verses to fit modern situations. 

For instance, one user reimagined Philippians 4:13, ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me,"" to ""I can do all things, including procrastinate, thanks to coffee."" Another popular twist involved Psalm 23, humorously adapted to reflect the struggles of navigating daily life, with lines about avoiding traffic and finding Wi-Fi.

The unexpected shift from spiritual reflection to meme culture sparked a lively discussion about the intersection of faith and humor on social media. Many users expressed appreciation for the lighthearted approach, noting that it made the verses more relatable. As the meme continued to spread, it highlighted the evolving ways people engage with religious texts in the digital age.",0.8223938345909119,1,1

"the prestigious BAFTA Awards. The couple arrived in style, with the Duchess dazzling in a custom-made gown that shimmered under the venue's grand chandeliers. As they mingled with A-list celebrities, the atmosphere buzzed with excitement and anticipation for the evening's accolades.

This year’s ceremony celebrated a diverse range of films, with ""The Power of the Dog"" leading the nominations. The film's director, Jane Campion, made history as the first woman to be nominated for Best Director twice, and her emotional acceptance speech resonated with many in the audience. 

Other notable winners included Will Smith, who took home the Best Actor award for his role in ""King Richard,"" and Jessica Chastain, who won Best Actress for her performance in ""The Eyes of Tammy Faye."" The night concluded with a moving tribute to the late actor, Sir Sean Connery, reminding everyone of his lasting impact on the film industry.",0.8070574998855591,1,1
"...wasn't amused by the attempt at humor. In fact, the former Vice President took to social media to express his disapproval, stating that the portrayal of his family's beloved pet was not only disrespectful but also indicative of a broader trend of intolerance towards traditional values. Pence's response sparked a wave of reactions online, with supporters rallying behind him and critics defending Oliver's satirical approach.

The controversy highlights the ongoing cultural clash between conservative and progressive viewpoints, particularly in the realm of entertainment. While Oliver and his friends may see their work as a form of comedy, many argue that it crosses the line into mockery. As the debate rages on, it raises questions about the role of humor in addressing serious topics and whether it can truly foster understanding or simply deepen divides. The incident serves as a reminder of the power of media and the responsibility that comes with it.",0.7559857368469238,1,1
"...Somers and Bob McManaman discussed the latest updates on the Arizona Cardinals' injury report as they prepare to face the Philadelphia Eagles this weekend. The Cardinals have been grappling with several key injuries that could impact their performance on the field. Star quarterback Kyler Murray is still recovering from a lingering ankle issue, while standout wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins is dealing with a hamstring strain that has limited his practice time.

The duo emphasized the importance of depth in the roster, noting that players stepping up in crucial moments could make a significant difference against a formidable Eagles defense. They also highlighted the need for the offensive line to provide solid protection to give Murray time to make plays. As the Cardinals aim to secure a vital win, the health of their key players will be a focal point leading into the matchup, with fans eagerly awaiting updates as game day approaches.",0.892967939376831,1,1
"...resilience of corporate earnings. Major companies across various sectors have reported stronger-than-anticipated profits, driven by robust consumer spending and effective cost management strategies. Analysts note that this trend has bolstered investor confidence, leading to a surge in stock prices and a renewed optimism about economic recovery.

Tech giants, in particular, have outperformed expectations, showcasing innovation and adaptability in a rapidly changing market. Financial institutions have also reported solid gains, benefiting from rising interest rates and increased lending activity. 

However, some market watchers caution that while the current earnings reports are encouraging, potential headwinds remain. Concerns over inflation, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions could pose risks to future growth. As investors digest these results, many are closely monitoring guidance from company executives for insights into the sustainability of this momentum in the latter half of the year.",0.8332496285438538,1,1
"As usual, we have the deep-dive Coffee Lake coverage in our Core i7-8700K Review: Coffee Lake Brews A Great Gaming CPU review, but for those of you without the time to sift through all 13 pages, we've condensed all of our gaming results to give you a cheat sheet of sorts on Intel's new halo product.
Coffee Lake has arrived, and after nearly a decade of quad-core doldrums in Intel's mainstream desktop space, the company finally decided to bulk up its Core i7, i5, and i3 series. Intel added two more cores to each of the families and also increased the Turbo Boost frequencies to the highest an Intel chip has seen. Better yet, those increased resources come with a minimal price increase over the Kaby Lake models for the unlocked K-series chips, and the same price for the locked models. We can thank AMD for that.
We also have articles that compare Intel's full Coffee Lake lineup to Kaby Lake and a full breakdown of comparisons to AMD's beefy Ryzen stable.
And No, Coffee Lake will not run in Z270 motherboards.

This. Our 99th percentile FPS chart provides a geometric mean of the results, converted into an FPS measurement, of all the games in our test suite. That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

But bleeding edge performance is only part of the equation. We demand good value--a point AMD drove home with its speedy Ryzen lineup. Intel has obviously taken note, and the additional cores comes without radical price increases. Overall, the Core i7-8700K represents a solid value for those who demand the ultimate in performance, and the lesser Core i5 and i3 SKUs also look promising for the more pragmatic among us.
The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year.

Gabriel's decision leaves the Wildcats with a young roster, as head coach John Calipari will need to rely heavily on incoming recruits and returning players to fill the void.

The data suggests that government stimulus measures and a rebound in global trade are beginning to take effect, bolstering confidence among manufacturers. New orders surged, with export orders also showing signs of improvement, driven by a recovery in key markets.

However, challenges remain, including rising raw material costs and supply chain disruptions.

Better yet, those increased resources come with a minimal price increase over the Kaby Lake models for the unlocked K-series chips, and the same price for the locked models. We can thank AMD for that.
We also have articles that compare Intel's full Coffee Lake lineup to Kaby Lake and a full breakdown of comparisons to AMD's beefy Ryzen stable.
And No, Coffee Lake will not run in Z270 motherboards.
So, if you whip out your wallet for Intel's six-core, 12-thread flagship and a new motherboard, what does that give you on the gaming front?

This. Our 99th percentile FPS chart provides a geometric mean of the results, converted into an FPS measurement, of all the games in our test suite. That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

But bleeding edge performance is only part of the equation. We demand good value--a point AMD drove home with its speedy Ryzen lineup. Intel has obviously taken note, and the additional cores comes without radical price increases. Overall, the Core i7-8700K represents a solid value for those who demand the ultimate in performance, and the lesser Core i5 and i3 SKUs also look promising for the more pragmatic among us.
The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year. Knowing this, should you upgrade now or wait for the next wave of hardware? Due to the iterative nature of most updates, we rarely recommend jumping forward one, or even two generations. However, if you routinely find yourself running productivity workloads that might be served well by Core i7-8700K's extra cores, we could see replacing a quad-core chip with six cores. Gamers interested in maximum performance or streaming also stand to benefit, though in a world of single-GPU graphics configurations, you'd be hard-pressed to bottleneck an overclocked -7700K with even a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (particularly at the high resolutions it's meant to drive).
The Core i7-8700K took home our Editor's Choice award. So feel free to take a dip in Coffee Lake if you've got the dosh--we doubt you'll be disappointed. We're working on testing the i5 and i3 models now, so stay tuned.",1.0769720077514648,0,1

"...which plays a crucial role in testosterone production and overall sexual health. Recent studies have shown that zinc deficiency can lead to reduced libido and fertility issues in both men and women. Oysters, being one of the richest sources of zinc, can potentially enhance sexual desire and performance.

Moreover, oysters are also packed with amino acids that may trigger the production of sex hormones. The combination of these nutrients not only supports reproductive health but may also improve mood and energy levels, further contributing to a romantic atmosphere.

While the idea of oysters as an aphrodisiac has been around for centuries, scientific backing adds a new layer of credibility to this age-old belief. So, whether you’re planning a romantic dinner or simply looking to spice things up, indulging in a plate of fresh oysters might just be the perfect addition to your evening. Just remember to enjoy them responsibly!",0.9001272320747375,1,1

The Lodgepole Complex fire, which began in late July, has been particularly challenging due to its rapid spread fueled by strong winds and dry vegetation. Local communities have rallied together, providing support to those displaced by the fires and assisting in recovery efforts. 

State officials are urging residents to remain vigilant and adhere to fire restrictions, as the potential for new fires continues. The Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation is assessing the damage and coordinating resources for affected areas, while also emphasizing the importance of preparedness for future fire seasons. As the summer draws to a close, the focus shifts to recovery and rebuilding for those impacted by this devastating wildfire season.",0.819978654384613,1,1
"the headteacher explained that the decision comes after consultations with staff, who expressed the need for additional time to prepare lessons and manage their workload. The proposed change would see the school finish at 1:30 PM on Fridays, allowing teachers to use the extra time for planning, grading, and professional development.

Parents have been invited to share their thoughts on the proposal, with many expressing support for the initiative. ""It's important for teachers to have a good work-life balance,"" said one parent. ""Happy teachers create a better learning environment for our children.""

The school plans to hold a meeting next week to discuss the feedback and finalize the decision. If approved, the new schedule could be implemented as early as next term. The headteacher emphasized that the well-being of both staff and students is a top priority, and this change aims to foster a more sustainable teaching environment.",0.7403846383094788,1,1

This. Our 99th percentile FPS chart provides a geometric mean of the results, converted into an FPS measurement, of all the games in our test suite. That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

But bleeding edge performance is only part of the equation. We demand good value--a point AMD drove home with its speedy Ryzen lineup. Intel has obviously taken note, and the additional cores comes without radical price increases. Overall, the Core i7-8700K represents a solid value for those who demand the ultimate in performance, and the lesser Core i5 and i3 SKUs also look promising for the more pragmatic among us.
The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year. Knowing this, should you upgrade now or wait for the next wave of hardware? Due to the iterative nature of most updates, we rarely recommend jumping forward one, or even two generations. However, if you routinely find yourself running productivity workloads that might be served well by Core i7-8700K's extra cores, we could see replacing a quad-core chip with six cores. Gamers interested in maximum performance or streaming also stand to benefit, though in a world of single-GPU graphics configurations, you'd be hard-pressed to bottleneck an overclocked -7700K with even a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (particularly at the high resolutions it's meant to drive).
The Core i7-8700K took home our Editor's Choice award. So feel free to take a dip in Coffee Lake if you've got the dosh--we doubt you'll be disappointed. We're working on testing the i5 and i3 models now, so stay tuned.",1.0769720077514648,0,1
"...that the encounter left her feeling uncomfortable and pressured. In a recent interview, Drake recounted the details of the meeting, stating that Trump made advances towards her, which she declined. ""I felt like I was being put in a position where I had to say yes, but I stood my ground,"" she said. Drake emphasized the importance of consent and the power dynamics often at play in such situations. 

Her story resurfaced amid ongoing discussions about sexual misconduct and accountability in the entertainment industry. Drake has since become an advocate for women's rights, using her platform to raise awareness about the challenges faced by women in similar situations. ""It's crucial for us to speak out and support one another,"" she added.

In her appearance on ""Late Night with Seth Meyers,"" Duckworth expressed her concerns over the unpredictable nature of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, emphasizing the importance of diplomatic engagement while maintaining a strong defense posture. 

Reflecting on her own military background, Duckworth shared how her experiences in the Army have shaped her perspective on national security and foreign policy. She highlighted the need for Congress to work collaboratively, despite partisan differences, to address pressing global issues. 

Duckworth also touched on the personal toll that political life can take, revealing the stress and pressure that come with being a public servant. She urged viewers to remain engaged in the political process and to support leaders who prioritize unity and constructive dialogue.

The pop star, known for her outspoken nature, sparked outrage when she dismissed the significance of her early music, claiming it was ""just a phase"" in her career. Fans took to social media to express their disappointment, arguing that her earlier work was foundational to her success and resonated deeply with many.

Cyrus, who has evolved her sound and image over the years, seemed to downplay the impact of her hits like ""Party in the USA"" and ""Wrecking Ball."" Critics argue that her comments undermine the connection she built with her audience during those formative years. 

In response to the backlash, Miley took to Instagram to clarify her remarks, stating that she appreciates all her music and the fans who supported her throughout her journey. However, the damage was done, and many are still voicing their frustrations over her perceived disregard for her past.",0.8773275017738342,1,1
"...was a racially motivated attack. The shooter, identified as a 28-year-old local man, reportedly drove through the city in a car, targeting individuals of African descent. Witnesses described scenes of chaos as the gunman fired indiscriminately, prompting a swift response from law enforcement.

Authorities apprehended the suspect shortly after the shooting, and he is now facing multiple charges, including attempted murder. The injured victims were taken to nearby hospitals, with some in serious condition, sparking outrage and fear within the migrant community.

Local officials condemned the attack, calling it an act of hate that undermines the values of tolerance and coexistence. The incident has reignited debates over immigration policies and the rise of far-right sentiments in Italy, as protests against racism and xenophobia are expected to take place in the coming days.

This. Our 99th percentile FPS chart provides a geometric mean of the results, converted into an FPS measurement, of all the games in our test suite. That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

But bleeding edge performance is only part of the equation. We demand good value--a point AMD drove home with its speedy Ryzen lineup. Intel has obviously taken note, and the additional cores comes without radical price increases. Overall, the Core i7-8700K represents a solid value for those who demand the ultimate in performance, and the lesser Core i5 and i3 SKUs also look promising for the more pragmatic among us.
The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year. Knowing this, should you upgrade now or wait for the next wave of hardware? Due to the iterative nature of most updates, we rarely recommend jumping forward one, or even two generations. However, if you routinely find yourself running productivity workloads that might be served well by Core i7-8700K's extra cores, we could see replacing a quad-core chip with six cores. Gamers interested in maximum performance or streaming also stand to benefit, though in a world of single-GPU graphics configurations, you'd be hard-pressed to bottleneck an overclocked -7700K with even a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (particularly at the high resolutions it's meant to drive).
The Core i7-8700K took home our Editor's Choice award. So feel free to take a dip in Coffee Lake if you've got the dosh--we doubt you'll be disappointed. We're working on testing the i5 and i3 models now, so stay tuned.",1.0769720077514648,0,1
"As usual, we have the deep-dive Coffee Lake coverage in our Core i7-8700K Review: Coffee Lake Brews A Great Gaming CPU review, but for those of you without the time to sift through all 13 pages, we've condensed all of our gaming results to give you a cheat sheet of sorts on Intel's new halo product.
Coffee Lake has arrived, and after nearly a decade of quad-core doldrums in Intel's mainstream desktop space, the company finally decided to bulk up its Core i7, i5, and i3 series. Intel added two more cores to each of the families and also increased the Turbo Boost frequencies to the highest an Intel chip has seen. Better yet, those increased resources come with a minimal price increase over the Kaby Lake models for the unlocked K-series chips, and the same price for the locked models. We can thank AMD for that.
We also have articles that compare Intel's full Coffee Lake lineup to Kaby Lake and a full breakdown of comparisons to AMD's beefy Ryzen stable.
And No, Coffee Lake will not run in Z270 motherboards.
So, if you whip out your wallet for Intel's six-core, 12-thread flagship and a new motherboard, what does that give you on the gaming front?

"...aviation giants. Founded in the 1920s, Lockheed quickly became synonymous with innovation, producing iconic aircraft like the P-38 Lightning and the Constellation. The company played a pivotal role during World War II, contributing to the Allied victory with its advanced designs and manufacturing capabilities.

As the post-war era unfolded, Lockheed shifted its focus to commercial aviation, introducing the L-1011 TriStar, a wide-body airliner that showcased cutting-edge technology and comfort. However, the rise of competitors and economic challenges led to a decline in its dominance.

Today, while Lockheed Martin has evolved into a leader in defense and aerospace, the legacy of its Burbank roots remains a point of pride for the community. Local enthusiasts often reminisce about the golden age of aviation, where the skies were filled with the sounds of Lockheed aircraft, symbolizing a time of exploration and technological advancement that shaped the future of air travel.",0.8854731917381287,1,1

With a strong batting lineup led by captain Rohit Sharma and the explosive Suryakumar Yadav, they aim to set a solid foundation in their upcoming match. The all-round capabilities of Hardik Pandya and Kieron Pollard will be crucial in both batting and bowling departments.

On the bowling front, Jasprit Bumrah remains a key player, known for his death-over expertise, while Mustafizur Rahman adds variety with his left-arm pace. The team will also rely on the spin of Mayank Markande to exploit any turn on the pitch.

In contrast, their opponents have shown resilience and will be eager to capitalize on any weaknesses. As the match approaches, both teams are expected to finalize their strategies, with Mumbai Indians keen to secure a vital win to stay competitive in the league standings.",0.8466076850891113,1,1
"...military dominance. In a recent address, Mattis emphasized that both nations are investing heavily in advanced technologies, including hypersonic weapons and cyber capabilities, which could undermine the effectiveness of U.S. deterrence strategies. He noted that these developments necessitate a reevaluation of America's defense posture and a commitment to modernizing its own nuclear arsenal.

Mattis highlighted the importance of maintaining a credible deterrent while also enhancing alliances with NATO and other partners to counter these emerging threats. He called for increased funding for research and development to ensure that the U.S. military remains at the forefront of technological advancements. The Defence Secretary's remarks come amid growing concerns over the strategic implications of Russia's military actions in Eastern Europe and China's assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. As tensions rise, the U.S. is urged to adapt its defense strategies to address the evolving landscape of global security challenges.",0.8056871891021729,1,1

Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur all secured their spots in the knockout rounds, marking a significant achievement for English football. The draw will take place at 12:00 GMT, and fans are eagerly anticipating potential matchups against some of Europe’s elite teams.

City, the defending champions, will be looking to maintain their title defense, while Liverpool aims to reclaim their former glory in the competition. Chelsea and Manchester United, both with rich histories in the tournament, are hoping to make deep runs this season. Tottenham, having struggled in recent years, will be keen to prove their worth on the continental stage.

Each club will be hoping for favorable draws, as they navigate the challenges of facing top-tier opponents. The excitement surrounding the draw is palpable, with supporters keen to see how their teams will fare in the next phase of this prestigious tournament.",0.800899863243103,1,1

This. Our 99th percentile FPS chart provides a geometric mean of the results, converted into an FPS measurement, of all the games in our test suite. That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

But bleeding edge performance is only part of the equation. We demand good value--a point AMD drove home with its speedy Ryzen lineup. Intel has obviously taken note, and the additional cores comes without radical price increases. Overall, the Core i7-8700K represents a solid value for those who demand the ultimate in performance, and the lesser Core i5 and i3 SKUs also look promising for the more pragmatic among us.
The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year. Knowing this, should you upgrade now or wait for the next wave of hardware? Due to the iterative nature of most updates, we rarely recommend jumping forward one, or even two generations. However, if you routinely find yourself running productivity workloads that might be served well by Core i7-8700K's extra cores, we could see replacing a quad-core chip with six cores. Gamers interested in maximum performance or streaming also stand to benefit, though in a world of single-GPU graphics configurations, you'd be hard-pressed to bottleneck an overclocked -7700K with even a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (particularly at the high resolutions it's meant to drive).
The Core i7-8700K took home our Editor's Choice award. So feel free to take a dip in Coffee Lake if you've got the dosh--we doubt you'll be disappointed. We're working on testing the i5 and i3 models now, so stay tuned.",1.0769720077514648,0,1

"...Vettel, who started from pole position, faced intense pressure from Bottas in the closing stages of the race. The Finnish driver, who had been gaining ground after a late pit stop, pushed hard to close the gap, but Vettel's experience and skill behind the wheel proved decisive. 

As the two cars raced side by side through the final corners, the tension in the air was palpable. Vettel managed to hold his line, expertly navigating the tricky turns while Bottas looked for any opportunity to overtake. In a nail-biting finish, the German crossed the line just 0.6 seconds ahead of Bottas, securing his first victory of the season and giving Ferrari a much-needed boost in the championship standings.

Post-race, Vettel expressed his relief and joy, stating, ""It was a tough battle, but we kept our cool and executed our strategy perfectly."" The win marked a significant moment for Ferrari, reigniting hopes for a competitive season ahead.",0.7488176822662354,1,1
"California lawmakers have reintroduced a bill aimed at achieving 100-percent carbon-free energy by 2045, reigniting discussions on the state's ambitious climate goals. The legislation, which had previously faced hurdles, seeks to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Proponents argue that this move is essential for combating climate change and ensuring a sustainable future for the state.

The bill outlines a comprehensive framework for increasing renewable energy production while phasing out reliance on natural gas and other carbon-emitting sources. Supporters, including environmental groups and clean energy advocates, emphasize the economic benefits of green jobs and the potential for California to lead the nation in climate policy. However, critics express concerns about the feasibility of such a rapid transition and the potential impact on energy prices. As the legislative session progresses, the bill's fate remains uncertain, but it reflects California's ongoing commitment to environmental leadership.",0.800000011920929,1,1

"the region, experts say. With India as a member, the SCO has gained a more diverse perspective on security and economic issues, particularly in relation to counter-terrorism and regional connectivity. Analysts believe that India's participation can enhance cooperation among member states, particularly in areas such as trade, energy security, and cultural exchanges.

India's strategic interests align with the SCO's goals, especially in combating extremism and fostering economic development in Central Asia. The country’s involvement is expected to facilitate greater collaboration on infrastructure projects, which are crucial for enhancing trade routes and connectivity across the region.

"As usual, we have the deep-dive Coffee Lake coverage in our Core i7-8700K Review: Coffee Lake Brews A Great Gaming CPU review, but for those of you without the time to sift through all 13 pages, we've condensed all of our gaming results to give you a cheat sheet of sorts on Intel's new halo product.
Coffee Lake has arrived, and after nearly a decade of quad-core doldrums in Intel's mainstream desktop space, the company finally decided to bulk up its Core i7, i5, and i3 series. Intel added two more cores to each of the families and also increased the Turbo Boost frequencies to the highest an Intel chip has seen. Better yet, those increased resources come with a minimal price increase over the Kaby Lake models for the unlocked K-series chips, and the same price for the locked models. We can thank AMD for that.
We also have articles that compare Intel's full Coffee Lake lineup to Kaby Lake and a full breakdown of comparisons to AMD's beefy Ryzen stable.
And No, Coffee Lake will not run in Z270 motherboards.
So, if you whip out your wallet for Intel's six-core, 12-thread flagship and a new motherboard, what does that give you on the gaming front?

This. Our 99th percentile FPS chart provides a geometric mean of the results, converted into an FPS measurement, of all the games in our test suite. That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

But bleeding edge performance is only part of the equation. We demand good value--a point AMD drove home with its speedy Ryzen lineup. Intel has obviously taken note, and the additional cores comes without radical price increases. Overall, the Core i7-8700K represents a solid value for those who demand the ultimate in performance, and the lesser Core i5 and i3 SKUs also look promising for the more pragmatic among us.
The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year. Knowing this, should you upgrade now or wait for the next wave of hardware? Due to the iterative nature of most updates, we rarely recommend jumping forward one, or even two generations. However, if you routinely find yourself running productivity workloads that might be served well by Core i7-8700K's extra cores, we could see replacing a quad-core chip with six cores. Gamers interested in maximum performance or streaming also stand to benefit, though in a world of single-GPU graphics configurations, you'd be hard-pressed to bottleneck an overclocked -7700K with even a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (particularly at the high resolutions it's meant to drive).
The Core i7-8700K took home our Editor's Choice award. So feel free to take a dip in Coffee Lake if you've got the dosh--we doubt you'll be disappointed. We're working on testing the i5 and i3 models now, so stay tuned.",1.0769720077514648,0,1

"...Commission (CQC) following an inspection. The CQC highlighted several areas of concern, including response times and the need for better management of resources. Inspectors noted that while some staff provided compassionate care, there were inconsistencies in service delivery that affected patient outcomes.

The report pointed out that the trust struggled to meet national response time targets, particularly for emergency calls. Patients reported long waits for ambulances, which raised concerns about their safety and well-being. The Chief Inspector emphasized the importance of addressing these issues promptly to ensure that patients receive timely and effective care.

In response, the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust acknowledged the findings and committed to implementing a comprehensive improvement plan. This plan will focus on enhancing training for staff, optimizing resource allocation, and improving communication with patients.

Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

But bleeding edge performance is only part of the equation. We demand good value--a point AMD drove home with its speedy Ryzen lineup. Intel has obviously taken note, and the additional cores comes without radical price increases. Overall, the Core i7-8700K represents a solid value for those who demand the ultimate in performance, and the lesser Core i5 and i3 SKUs also look promising for the more pragmatic among us.
The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year. Knowing this, should you upgrade now or wait for the next wave of hardware? Due to the iterative nature of most updates, we rarely recommend jumping forward one, or even two generations. However, if you routinely find yourself running productivity workloads that might be served well by Core i7-8700K's extra cores, we could see replacing a quad-core chip with six cores. Gamers interested in maximum performance or streaming also stand to benefit, though in a world of single-GPU graphics configurations, you'd be hard-pressed to bottleneck an overclocked -7700K with even a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (particularly at the high resolutions it's meant to drive).
The Core i7-8700K took home our Editor's Choice award. So feel free to take a dip in Coffee Lake if you've got the dosh--we doubt you'll be disappointed. We're working on testing the i5 and i3 models now, so stay tuned.",1.0769720077514648,0,1
"As usual, we have the deep-dive Coffee Lake coverage in our Core i7-8700K Review: Coffee Lake Brews A Great Gaming CPU review, but for those of you without the time to sift through all 13 pages, we've condensed all of our gaming results to give you a cheat sheet of sorts on Intel's new halo product.
Coffee Lake has arrived, and after nearly a decade of quad-core doldrums in Intel's mainstream desktop space, the company finally decided to bulk up its Core i7, i5, and i3 series. Intel added two more cores to each of the families and also increased the Turbo Boost frequencies to the highest an Intel chip has seen. Better yet, those increased resources come with a minimal price increase over the Kaby Lake models for the unlocked K-series chips, and the same price for the locked models. We can thank AMD for that.
We also have articles that compare Intel's full Coffee Lake lineup to Kaby Lake and a full breakdown of comparisons to AMD's beefy Ryzen stable.
And No, Coffee Lake will not run in Z270 motherboards.
So, if you whip out your wallet for Intel's six-core, 12-thread flagship and a new motherboard, what does that give you on the gaming front?

"Gea this summer if the right offer comes in, as the club looks to reshape its squad. The Spanish goalkeeper, who has been a key figure for United since joining in 2011, has faced criticism for inconsistent performances in recent seasons. With the emergence of promising young talents and the potential for new signings, the club's management is considering a fresh approach to their goalkeeping situation.

Reports suggest that several clubs across Europe are monitoring De Gea's situation, with interest from teams in Spain and Italy. United's hierarchy is keen to ensure they receive a substantial fee for the 32-year-old, who has been a fan favorite and a crucial part of the team's success over the years. As the transfer window approaches, fans will be watching closely to see if De Gea's long tenure at Old Trafford comes to an end, paving the way for a new era in goal for Manchester United.",0.8211081624031067,1,1

The match was tightly contested, with both teams creating chances but failing to find the back of the net until the dramatic conclusion. The Rocks' defense held firm against the Metropolitan Police's attacks, showcasing their resilience and determination.

Manager John Smith praised his team's performance, highlighting their ability to stay focused under pressure. ""It was a tough game, but we showed great character to keep pushing until the end,"" he said. ""The own goal was unfortunate for them, but we’ll take the points.""

""China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,"" the ministry said in a statement, urging the U.S. to reconsider its approach. The announcement comes amid ongoing negotiations aimed at resolving trade disputes that have persisted for years, with both sides imposing tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods.

Analysts warn that further deterioration in relations could lead to a prolonged economic downturn, affecting not only the two nations but also the global market.

Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year. Knowing this, should you upgrade now or wait for the next wave of hardware? Due to the iterative nature of most updates, we rarely recommend jumping forward one, or even two generations. However, if you routinely find yourself running productivity workloads that might be served well by Core i7-8700K's extra cores, we could see replacing a quad-core chip with six cores. Gamers interested in maximum performance or streaming also stand to benefit, though in a world of single-GPU graphics configurations, you'd be hard-pressed to bottleneck an overclocked -7700K with even a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (particularly at the high resolutions it's meant to drive).
The Core i7-8700K took home our Editor's Choice award. So feel free to take a dip in Coffee Lake if you've got the dosh--we doubt you'll be disappointed. We're working on testing the i5 and i3 models now, so stay tuned.",1.0769720077514648,0,1
"As usual, we have the deep-dive Coffee Lake coverage in our Core i7-8700K Review: Coffee Lake Brews A Great Gaming CPU review, but for those of you without the time to sift through all 13 pages, we've condensed all of our gaming results to give you a cheat sheet of sorts on Intel's new halo product.
Coffee Lake has arrived, and after nearly a decade of quad-core doldrums in Intel's mainstream desktop space, the company finally decided to bulk up its Core i7, i5, and i3 series. Intel added two more cores to each of the families and also increased the Turbo Boost frequencies to the highest an Intel chip has seen. Better yet, those increased resources come with a minimal price increase over the Kaby Lake models for the unlocked K-series chips, and the same price for the locked models. We can thank AMD for that.
We also have articles that compare Intel's full Coffee Lake lineup to Kaby Lake and a full breakdown of comparisons to AMD's beefy Ryzen stable.
And No, Coffee Lake will not run in Z270 motherboards.
So, if you whip out your wallet for Intel's six-core, 12-thread flagship and a new motherboard, what does that give you on the gaming front?

This. Our 99th percentile FPS chart provides a geometric mean of the results, converted into an FPS measurement, of all the games in our test suite. That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

"...That wide receiver was rookie George Pickens, who has been making waves during training camp with his impressive catches and strong work ethic. With Bryant's return, the competition for roster spots has intensified, and Pickens is eager to prove himself. 

Head coach Mike Tomlin praised Pickens for his ability to adapt and learn quickly, noting that the young receiver has shown a maturity beyond his years. ""He’s got a unique skill set, and he’s not afraid to showcase it,"" Tomlin said. 

As the preseason approaches, the Steelers are looking to solidify their receiving corps, and both Bryant and Pickens will play crucial roles in that process. The team is optimistic about their offensive potential, especially with quarterback Mitch Trubisky at the helm.

"...of marginalized groups in tech has been a focal point in discussions about online safety. Many advocates argue that without diverse voices in decision-making roles, policies may not adequately address the unique challenges faced by different communities. Recent studies have shown that platforms often fail to protect users from targeted harassment, particularly women and people of color, leading to calls for more proactive measures.

In response, some companies are beginning to implement advanced algorithms and AI tools designed to detect and mitigate harmful behavior before it escalates. However, critics warn that technology alone cannot solve the problem; it must be accompanied by a cultural shift within organizations that prioritizes inclusivity and accountability. As the conversation around online safety evolves, tech giants are under increasing pressure to not only enforce their policies but also to ensure that their platforms foster a respectful and supportive environment for all users.",0.7832354307174683,1,1
"...confidence in your style choices, you'll find that expressing yourself through fashion can be both fun and empowering. Start by exploring your personal preferences—what colors, patterns, and silhouettes resonate with you? Consider creating a mood board or saving images that inspire you. 

Next, familiarize yourself with the basics of fashion, such as understanding body types and how to dress for them. This knowledge can help you select pieces that flatter your figure and enhance your best features. 

Don't hesitate to experiment with different styles; thrift stores and online marketplaces are great places to try new looks without breaking the bank. Additionally, following fashion influencers on social media can provide fresh ideas and insights into current trends. 

Finally, remember that fashion is about self-expression. Embrace your individuality, and don’t be afraid to step outside your comfort zone. With time and practice, you'll develop a wardrobe that truly reflects who you are.",0.6959663033485413,1,1

The launch comes amid heightened tensions in the region, with North Korea conducting a series of missile tests in recent months. Analysts suggest that these tests are intended to demonstrate the regime's resolve and technological advancements, even in the face of global condemnation. 

In response to the latest launch, the U.S. has reiterated its commitment to defending its allies in the region, particularly South Korea and Japan. Both countries have expressed concern over North Korea's aggressive posturing and have called for a united front to address the threat.

The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year. Knowing this, should you upgrade now or wait for the next wave of hardware? Due to the iterative nature of most updates, we rarely recommend jumping forward one, or even two generations. However, if you routinely find yourself running productivity workloads that might be served well by Core i7-8700K's extra cores, we could see replacing a quad-core chip with six cores. Gamers interested in maximum performance or streaming also stand to benefit, though in a world of single-GPU graphics configurations, you'd be hard-pressed to bottleneck an overclocked -7700K with even a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (particularly at the high resolutions it's meant to drive).
The Core i7-8700K took home our Editor's Choice award. So feel free to take a dip in Coffee Lake if you've got the dosh--we doubt you'll be disappointed. We're working on testing the i5 and i3 models now, so stay tuned.",1.0769720077514648,0,1

"As usual, we have the deep-dive Coffee Lake coverage in our Core i7-8700K Review: Coffee Lake Brews A Great Gaming CPU review, but for those of you without the time to sift through all 13 pages, we've condensed all of our gaming results to give you a cheat sheet of sorts on Intel's new halo product.
Coffee Lake has arrived, and after nearly a decade of quad-core doldrums in Intel's mainstream desktop space, the company finally decided to bulk up its Core i7, i5, and i3 series. Intel added two more cores to each of the families and also increased the Turbo Boost frequencies to the highest an Intel chip has seen. Better yet, those increased resources come with a minimal price increase over the Kaby Lake models for the unlocked K-series chips, and the same price for the locked models. We can thank AMD for that.
We also have articles that compare Intel's full Coffee Lake lineup to Kaby Lake and a full breakdown of comparisons to AMD's beefy Ryzen stable.
And No, Coffee Lake will not run in Z270 motherboards.
So, if you whip out your wallet for Intel's six-core, 12-thread flagship and a new motherboard, what does that give you on the gaming front?

This. Our 99th percentile FPS chart provides a geometric mean of the results, converted into an FPS measurement, of all the games in our test suite. That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

But bleeding edge performance is only part of the equation. We demand good value--a point AMD drove home with its speedy Ryzen lineup. Intel has obviously taken note, and the additional cores comes without radical price increases. Overall, the Core i7-8700K represents a solid value for those who demand the ultimate in performance, and the lesser Core i5 and i3 SKUs also look promising for the more pragmatic among us.
The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year. Knowing this, should you upgrade now or wait for the next wave of hardware? Due to the iterative nature of most updates, we rarely recommend jumping forward one, or even two generations. However, if you routinely find yourself running productivity workloads that might be served well by Core i7-8700K's extra cores, we could see replacing a quad-core chip with six cores. Gamers interested in maximum performance or streaming also stand to benefit, though in a world of single-GPU graphics configurations, you'd be hard-pressed to bottleneck an overclocked -7700K with even a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (particularly at the high resolutions it's meant to drive).
The Core i7-8700K took home our Editor's Choice award. So feel free to take a dip in Coffee Lake if you've got the dosh--we doubt you'll be disappointed. We're working on testing the i5 and i3 models now, so stay tuned.",1.0769720077514648,0,1

Nicole, a renowned model and entrepreneur, dazzled in a stunning floor-length gown that accentuated her figure, while Gary, a talented musician, complemented her look in a sharp tailored suit.

As they mingled with guests, the couple was seen sharing laughs and sweet moments, embodying the essence of love and partnership. Nicole took a moment to speak about the importance of the cause, expressing her passion for empowering young minds through education. 

Gary, who performed a few songs during the evening, dedicated one to Nicole, leaving the audience in awe of their chemistry. The night was filled with joy, and the couple's undeniable bond was evident as they posed for photos, radiating happiness and warmth.

The ministry emphasized that any discussions regarding the status of Crimea would be unacceptable and reiterated its commitment to maintaining control over the peninsula.

In response, Ukrainian officials condemned the statement, reaffirming their stance that Crimea is Ukrainian territory and calling for international support to restore sovereignty. The ongoing tensions have led to increased military presence in the region, with both sides conducting exercises that heighten fears of further escalation.

Western nations have largely supported Ukraine's position, imposing sanctions on Russia in response to its annexation of Crimea. Diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict have stalled, with both sides remaining firm in their positions, leaving the future of Crimea uncertain amidst ongoing geopolitical strife.",0.8517067432403564,1,1
"...and they managed to replicate that success with a solid performance. Hibernian took the lead in the first half when Kevin Nisbet found the back of the net with a well-placed shot from inside the box. Rangers struggled to find their rhythm, and despite several attempts, they were unable to break through Hibernian's organized defense.

The home side equalized shortly after the break when Alfredo Morelos scored with a powerful header from a corner kick, igniting hopes of a comeback among the Ibrox faithful. However, Hibernian responded quickly, regaining the lead through a stunning long-range effort from Martin Boyle that left Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor with no chance.

As the match progressed, Rangers pushed for another equalizer, but Hibernian's defense held firm, and the visitors secured a vital three points. The defeat leaves Rangers with questions to answer as they look to bounce back in their next fixture.",0.8078646063804626,1,1

'While Sam has been a fantastic leader and player for us, this tour is about the collective effort of the squad,' Gatland said. 'We have a number of players who are pushing for selection, and we want to ensure that we pick the best combination to take on the All Blacks.'

With several players impressing in the lead-up to the tour, including standout performances in the domestic leagues, Gatland is keen to keep the competition fierce.

The Core i7-8700K took home our Editor's Choice award. So feel free to take a dip in Coffee Lake if you've got the dosh--we doubt you'll be disappointed. We're working on testing the i5 and i3 models now, so stay tuned.",1.0769720077514648,0,1
"As usual, we have the deep-dive Coffee Lake coverage in our Core i7-8700K Review: Coffee Lake Brews A Great Gaming CPU review, but for those of you without the time to sift through all 13 pages, we've condensed all of our gaming results to give you a cheat sheet of sorts on Intel's new halo product.
Coffee Lake has arrived, and after nearly a decade of quad-core doldrums in Intel's mainstream desktop space, the company finally decided to bulk up its Core i7, i5, and i3 series. Intel added two more cores to each of the families and also increased the Turbo Boost frequencies to the highest an Intel chip has seen. Better yet, those increased resources come with a minimal price increase over the Kaby Lake models for the unlocked K-series chips, and the same price for the locked models. We can thank AMD for that.
We also have articles that compare Intel's full Coffee Lake lineup to Kaby Lake and a full breakdown of comparisons to AMD's beefy Ryzen stable.
And No, Coffee Lake will not run in Z270 motherboards.

This. Our 99th percentile FPS chart provides a geometric mean of the results, converted into an FPS measurement, of all the games in our test suite. That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

But bleeding edge performance is only part of the equation. We demand good value--a point AMD drove home with its speedy Ryzen lineup. Intel has obviously taken note, and the additional cores comes without radical price increases. Overall, the Core i7-8700K represents a solid value for those who demand the ultimate in performance, and the lesser Core i5 and i3 SKUs also look promising for the more pragmatic among us.
The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year. Knowing this, should you upgrade now or wait for the next wave of hardware? Due to the iterative nature of most updates, we rarely recommend jumping forward one, or even two generations.

"""...conference to unveil its latest features aimed at enhancing user experience and expanding its market reach. CEO Daniel Ek announced the launch of a new personalized podcast recommendation system, which leverages advanced algorithms to curate content based on individual listening habits. 

'We believe that podcasts are the future of audio entertainment, and our goal is to make it easier for users to discover new shows that resonate with their interests,' Ek stated. 

In addition to the podcast feature, Spotify revealed plans to introduce a family plan that allows multiple users to share a single subscription at a discounted rate. This move is seen as a strategic effort to attract more subscribers in a competitive market dominated by Apple Music and Amazon Music.

The announcement was met with enthusiasm from investors, as shares of Spotify rose by 5% following the event. Analysts predict that these innovations could significantly boost user engagement and retention in the coming months.""",0.7507836818695068,1,1
"...Berdych's serve early in the final set, taking a 3-1 lead. The Frenchman showcased his powerful groundstrokes and tactical prowess, keeping the pressure on the Czech player. Berdych, known for his resilience, fought back, leveling the score at 4-4 after a series of intense rallies. However, Chardy remained composed, breaking Berdych again to serve for the match at 5-4.

With the crowd on the edge of their seats, Chardy faced a break point but responded with an ace, showcasing his serving skills under pressure. He ultimately closed out the match with a forehand winner, sealing a hard-fought victory. The final score was 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 in favor of Chardy, who expressed his delight at the win. ""It was a tough match, especially after the delay, but I stayed focused and played my game,"" he said in the post-match interview.

"...Symphony Orchestra will take place at the historic Pallas Theatre in Nicosia. The first concert, scheduled for Thursday evening, will feature a selection of classical masterpieces, including works by Mozart and Debussy, showcasing the rich textures and harmonies that these instruments can create together. 

The second concert, set for Saturday, promises a more contemporary flair, with compositions by modern composers that highlight the versatility of the ensemble. Both performances aim to provide an intimate setting where the audience can experience the nuances of chamber music up close.

Tickets are available online and at the theatre box office, with discounts for students and seniors. Music enthusiasts are encouraged to arrive early to enjoy a pre-concert talk, where musicians will share insights about the pieces being performed.

"...Industrial Average dropping more than 300 points by midday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also experienced significant declines, reflecting a broader sell-off across major sectors. Analysts noted that the recent rise in bond yields, driven by expectations of continued interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, has raised concerns about borrowing costs and economic growth.

Investors are particularly wary of how a tighter labor market could exacerbate inflationary pressures, leading to a potential slowdown in consumer spending. ""The market is reacting to the fear that higher yields will stifle growth,"" said one market strategist. ""With inflation still a concern, any signs of a cooling job market could lead to more volatility.""

In response, defensive sectors such as utilities and consumer staples saw slight gains as investors sought safer havens. Meanwhile, tech stocks, which are often more sensitive to interest rate changes, faced the brunt of the sell-off, with many major companies seeing their shares decline sharply.",0.8121150135993958,1,1
"As usual, we have the deep-dive Coffee Lake coverage in our Core i7-8700K Review: Coffee Lake Brews A Great Gaming CPU review, but for those of you without the time to sift through all 13 pages, we've condensed all of our gaming results to give you a cheat sheet of sorts on Intel's new halo product.
Coffee Lake has arrived, and after nearly a decade of quad-core doldrums in Intel's mainstream desktop space, the company finally decided to bulk up its Core i7, i5, and i3 series. Intel added two more cores to each of the families and also increased the Turbo Boost frequencies to the highest an Intel chip has seen. Better yet, those increased resources come with a minimal price increase over the Kaby Lake models for the unlocked K-series chips, and the same price for the locked models. We can thank AMD for that.
We also have articles that compare Intel's full Coffee Lake lineup to Kaby Lake and a full breakdown of comparisons to AMD's beefy Ryzen stable.
And No, Coffee Lake will not run in Z270 motherboards.

This. Our 99th percentile FPS chart provides a geometric mean of the results, converted into an FPS measurement, of all the games in our test suite. That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

But bleeding edge performance is only part of the equation. We demand good value--a point AMD drove home with its speedy Ryzen lineup. Intel has obviously taken note, and the additional cores comes without radical price increases. Overall, the Core i7-8700K represents a solid value for those who demand the ultimate in performance, and the lesser Core i5 and i3 SKUs also look promising for the more pragmatic among us.
The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year.

For years, they searched for answers about their origins, often facing dead ends and heartbreak. Their journey took a surprising turn when they discovered a social media group dedicated to helping people find their biological families. 

With the help of DNA testing, the brothers were able to trace their lineage and eventually connect with their mother, who had been living in a different state. The emotional reunion took place in a park, where they embraced for the first time, tears of joy streaming down their faces. 

Their mother, who had been searching for them as well, expressed her relief and happiness at finally being together.

"...simpler investment strategies, such as using low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These options typically have lower management fees compared to actively managed funds, which can eat into your returns over time. However, while reducing costs is important, it’s equally crucial to ensure that your investment plan aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

The podcast emphasizes that complexity can lead to confusion and poor decision-making. Investors often feel overwhelmed by the multitude of choices available, which can result in analysis paralysis. By streamlining your investment approach, you can focus on what truly matters: consistent contributions and a long-term perspective.

Listeners are encouraged to evaluate their current portfolios and consider whether they are overcomplicating their investment strategies.

Intel added two more cores to each of the families and also increased the Turbo Boost frequencies to the highest an Intel chip has seen. Better yet, those increased resources come with a minimal price increase over the Kaby Lake models for the unlocked K-series chips, and the same price for the locked models. We can thank AMD for that.
We also have articles that compare Intel's full Coffee Lake lineup to Kaby Lake and a full breakdown of comparisons to AMD's beefy Ryzen stable.
And No, Coffee Lake will not run in Z270 motherboards.
So, if you whip out your wallet for Intel's six-core, 12-thread flagship and a new motherboard, what does that give you on the gaming front?

This. Our 99th percentile FPS chart provides a geometric mean of the results, converted into an FPS measurement, of all the games in our test suite. That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

But bleeding edge performance is only part of the equation. We demand good value--a point AMD drove home with its speedy Ryzen lineup. Intel has obviously taken note, and the additional cores comes without radical price increases. Overall, the Core i7-8700K represents a solid value for those who demand the ultimate in performance, and the lesser Core i5 and i3 SKUs also look promising for the more pragmatic among us.
The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year. Knowing this, should you upgrade now or wait for the next wave of hardware? Due to the iterative nature of most updates, we rarely recommend jumping forward one, or even two generations. However, if you routinely find yourself running productivity workloads that might be served well by Core i7-8700K's extra cores, we could see replacing a quad-core chip with six cores. Gamers interested in maximum performance or streaming also stand to benefit, though in a world of single-GPU graphics configurations, you'd be hard-pressed to bottleneck an overclocked -7700K with even a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (particularly at the high resolutions it's meant to drive).
The Core i7-8700K took home our Editor's Choice award. So feel free to take a dip in Coffee Lake if you've got the dosh--we doubt you'll be disappointed. We're working on testing the i5 and i3 models now, so stay tuned.",1.0769720077514648,0,1

"...to the media in an attempt to undermine Cohen's credibility. The lawyer, David Schwartz, claimed that the release of the financial documents was a deliberate act to sway public opinion against Cohen as he faces legal scrutiny over payments made to Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Schwartz stated that the leak was not only unethical but also potentially illegal, calling for an investigation into the matter. He emphasized that Cohen has been cooperating with authorities and that the unauthorized disclosure of his financial information could jeopardize ongoing legal proceedings.

Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, denied the allegations, asserting that the information was obtained through legitimate means and was in the public interest. The controversy surrounding the payments to Daniels continues to unfold, with both sides preparing for a potential court battle as the investigation into the matter intensifies.",0.8054662346839905,1,1
"...his business quietly, but his performance on the mound speaks volumes. On Friday night, Hendricks delivered a masterclass against the Nationals, showcasing his trademark precision and control. He pitched seven strong innings, allowing just two runs while striking out six batters. His ability to mix pitches kept the Nationals' hitters off balance, and he effectively navigated through a lineup that had been hot at the plate.

The Cubs' offense provided ample support, with Kris Bryant's RBI double in the sixth inning serving as a pivotal moment in the game. The Cubs took a commanding lead, and their bullpen held firm to secure the victory. Manager David Ross praised Hendricks after the game, noting his veteran presence and ability to execute under pressure. As the season progresses, the Cubs will rely heavily on Hendricks to anchor their rotation and guide them through the playoff push.",0.8376436829566956,1,1

In addition to the traditional events, this year’s fair will introduce new attractions, including a petting zoo and a talent show, encouraging community participation. Organizers are optimistic that this year’s fair will be one of the best yet, bringing together families and friends to celebrate the spirit of Norwood.",0.7351029515266418,1,1
"...family for his earlier remarks, acknowledging the hurt caused by his comments during a recent political rally. Kejriwal's shift in tone marks a significant departure from his usual confrontational style, as he seeks to mend fences ahead of the upcoming elections. 

In a press conference, he stated, ""I regret any pain my words may have caused. Politics should not come at the cost of personal relationships."" This unexpected gesture has sparked discussions among political analysts, who suggest that Kejriwal is attempting to broaden his appeal and foster alliances in a fragmented political landscape.

Sibal, in response, expressed appreciation for the apology, emphasizing the importance of civility in political discourse. Observers note that this move could be a strategic play by Kejriwal to position himself as a more conciliatory leader, potentially attracting voters who are weary of divisive politics. As the election season heats up, all eyes will be on how this change in approach impacts AAP's campaign strategy.",0.8928205370903015,1,1

That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

"...reported its latest earnings, noting that while the company had shown resilience during the pandemic, the current economic climate posed challenges. Cramer pointed out that Etsy's growth had been fueled by a surge in online shopping, but as consumers returned to brick-and-mortar stores, the sustainability of that growth was in question.

He highlighted that Etsy's unique marketplace, which focuses on handmade and vintage items, sets it apart from larger e-commerce giants. However, Cramer cautioned investors to consider the potential impact of rising inflation and supply chain issues on consumer spending. He suggested that while Etsy has a loyal customer base, the stock's valuation might not justify the risks in the current market environment.

Cramer concluded by advising viewers to keep a close eye on Etsy's upcoming sales trends and to be cautious before making any investment decisions, especially in a volatile tech sector.",0.7224599123001099,1,1
"...editor, and more. The Bowie Baysox edged out the Richmond Squirrels in a tightly contested series opener on Tuesday night, winning 4-3 at Prince George's Stadium. The game was marked by a late rally from the Squirrels, who scored two runs in the eighth inning, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Baysox's early lead.

Bowie's starting pitcher, Jake McCarthy, delivered a solid performance, striking out seven batters over six innings while allowing just one run. The Baysox offense was powered by a two-run homer from outfielder Alex Ramirez in the fourth inning, which proved crucial in securing the victory.

Richmond's bullpen kept the game close, but a costly error in the seventh allowed Bowie to extend their lead. The Squirrels will look to bounce back in the second game of the series, with hopes of leveling the matchup against their division rivals.",0.7681432366371155,1,1
"...for losing track of the scoreline as the match unfolded. United took the lead early in the first half through a well-placed header from Marcus Rashford, who capitalized on a corner kick. West Ham, however, responded with vigor, pushing forward and creating several chances, but their efforts were thwarted by a resolute United defense.

The turning point came just before halftime when West Ham's defender received a second yellow card for a reckless challenge, leaving his team to battle with ten men. United seized the opportunity, dominating possession and increasing their attacking intensity. Bruno Fernandes doubled the lead with a stunning strike from outside the box, leaving the West Ham goalkeeper with no chance.

As the match progressed, United continued to press, and Alejandro Garnacho added a third goal late in the game, sealing a comprehensive victory. The win not only boosts United's confidence but also solidifies their position in the top four as they aim for Champions League qualification.",0.7752631306648254,1,1

Analysts suggest that the saturation of the smartphone market, coupled with economic uncertainties, is leading to a decline in iPhone sales. This trend raises concerns about Apple's ability to maintain its revenue growth, as the iPhone accounts for a significant portion of the company's overall income.

In response to these challenges, Apple is reportedly exploring new strategies, including diversifying its product lineup and enhancing services such as Apple Music and iCloud. The company is also investing in augmented reality and other emerging technologies to attract consumers.

And No, Coffee Lake will not run in Z270 motherboards.
So, if you whip out your wallet for Intel's six-core, 12-thread flagship and a new motherboard, what does that give you on the gaming front?

This. Our 99th percentile FPS chart provides a geometric mean of the results, converted into an FPS measurement, of all the games in our test suite. That single figure boils the story down pretty nicely, although we've also provided the performance results in each game so you can see how the Core i7-8700K fares in your favorite titles.
Despite a few missteps, the Core i7-8700K lives up to Intel’s claims. Although it doesn't beat the -7700K by a massive margin, the Coffee Lake flagship does deliver better performance in stock and overclocked form. AMD's Ryzen processors still offer competitive pricing and solid gaming performance, but Coffee Lake's gaming performance widens the gap considerably.
Intel's additional cores speed up performance in threaded tasks, which will also be a boon for the streaming crowd, but the faster Turbo Boost (up to 4.7 GHz) maintains the company's advantage in single threaded titles, albeit with a few cases of a slight step back from the Kaby Lake processors.

But bleeding edge performance is only part of the equation. We demand good value--a point AMD drove home with its speedy Ryzen lineup. Intel has obviously taken note, and the additional cores comes without radical price increases. Overall, the Core i7-8700K represents a solid value for those who demand the ultimate in performance, and the lesser Core i5 and i3 SKUs also look promising for the more pragmatic among us.
The Core i7-8700K is simple to overclock and won't require exotic cooling solutions unless you're chasing the bleeding edge, which makes it a fun chip for enthusiasts.
Altogether, the Core i7-8700K is the nimblest gaming chip we've tested, and it also offers surprising performance in our full suite of application tests. As we noted in the review:
Intel has its 10nm Cannon Lake processors coming in the second half of 2018, and AMD has a Ryzen refresh cycle coming next year. Knowing this, should you upgrade now or wait for the next wave of hardware? Due to the iterative nature of most updates, we rarely recommend jumping forward one, or even two generations. However, if you routinely find yourself running productivity workloads that might be served well by Core i7-8700K's extra cores, we could see replacing a quad-core chip with six cores. Gamers interested in maximum performance or streaming also stand to benefit, though in a world of single-GPU graphics configurations, you'd be hard-pressed to bottleneck an overclocked -7700K with even a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (particularly at the high resolutions it's meant to drive).
The Core i7-8700K took home our Editor's Choice award. So feel free to take a dip in Coffee Lake if you've got the dosh--we doubt you'll be disappointed. We're working on testing the i5 and i3 models now, so stay tuned.",1.0769720077514648,0,1
"As usual, we have the deep-dive Coffee Lake coverage in our Core i7-8700K Review: Coffee Lake Brews A Great Gaming CPU review, but for those of you without the time to sift through all 13 pages, we've condensed all of our gaming results to give you a cheat sheet of sorts on Intel's new halo product.
Coffee Lake has arrived, and after nearly a decade of quad-core doldrums in Intel's mainstream desktop space, the company finally decided to bulk up its Core i7, i5, and i3 series. Intel added two more cores to each of the families and also increased the Turbo Boost frequencies to the highest an Intel chip has seen. Better yet, those increased resources come with a minimal price increase over the Kaby Lake models for the unlocked K-series chips, and the same price for the locked models. We can thank AMD for that.

"and deregulation. Investors were optimistic that Trump's policies would stimulate economic growth and lead to higher corporate profits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged, closing up over 250 points on the day following the election, marking one of its largest single-day gains in recent history.

Financial and healthcare stocks led the charge, as traders anticipated significant changes in policy that could benefit these sectors. The prospect of tax cuts was particularly appealing to businesses, which had long been advocating for a reduction in corporate tax rates. Additionally, infrastructure spending plans promised to create jobs and boost demand across various industries.

However, analysts cautioned that the market's enthusiasm could be tempered by the challenges of implementing such sweeping reforms. Uncertainty surrounding trade policies and potential geopolitical tensions also loomed large, prompting some investors to remain cautious despite the initial euphoria.
