Wilson was on unit patrol at Harbor Beach tower 14 along with veteran lifeguard Mike Wagner.\n\u201cIt was a pretty busy day,\u201d Wilson said.\nHe began his day instructing students in the Junior Lifeguard Program. He then continued to put in patrol hours due to sizable summer crowds and rough seas.\nEarlier that afternoon he was part of several land and sea rescues, including getting a child out of a locked sweltering car.\nThen came a distress call about a solo jet skier crashed on the jetty at the mouth of the harbor. The location of the accident is nicknamed the \u201cdevil\u2019s triangle\u201d due to the dangers the rock jetty poses.\nWilson responded and found the man thrown off the jet ski, semiconscious, wedged between two boulders and unable to free himself. He attempted to free the man as consistent sets of pounding waves hit him and the victim.\nWhile Wilson aided the victim a city harbor officer pulled up in a patrol boat and lent a hand in the difficult rescue. The two were able to put a lifejacket under the victim\u2019s head as a buoy.\nTo set the man free, Wilson needed to dive underwater and release the victim\u2019s legs. Eventually the pair dislodged the man, but not without getting knocked down by waves and enduring some major scrapes from the surrounding rocks, which Wilson described as a cheese grater.\n\u201cIt seemed forever, we got beat up pretty well, yelling \u2018brace\u2019 between waves,\u201d Wilson said.\nA city firefighter arrived and the three pulled the victim from the rocks between sets of waves, up onto a stretcher and to an awaiting air ambulance. Due to HIPPA privacy laws the name of the victim has not been released.\n\u201cNo doubt that without his iron effort, knowledge and skill in the ocean environment, a life would have been lost,\u201d Capt. Bill Curtis, Oceanside Fire Department Lifeguard Division, said.\n\u201cDavid knowingly placed himself in harm\u2019s way with one goal and an incredible outcome.\u201d\nFor most the work day would end there, but Wilson showered off his cut leg and returned to duty to help with an issued code five alert. That afternoon he pulled 20 people from the harbor\u2019s choppy waters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the crazier situations I\u2019ve been in,\u201d Wilson said.\nCode five rescue operations involved every lifeguard on duty. Wilson said to aid multiple people in distress his partner paddled out on a rescue board, directed a group of five people to hold on and Wilson swam two of them at a time into shore.\n\u201cIt was a good day with a positive outcome,\u201d Wilson said.\nDespite his long day and injuries Wilson was at the Junior Lifeguard Program the following morning instructing potential future guards.\nThe recognition ceremony for his heroism took place in Sacramento on Sept. 25. Out of 21 applicants Wilson was the only one to receive the prestigious Governor\u2019s Public Safety Medal of Valor this year.\nWilson grew up in Oceanside and has served as a city lifeguard since 2012. He just completed criminal justice studies and plans to pursue a career as a State Beach peace officer ranger\/lifeguard.\nHe said his career path was inspired by fellow Oceanside lifeguards whose rescues have become legend.\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of people in this profession who get recognized for their amazing feats,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI\u2019m beyond blessed being able to do this.\u201d\nLast year Oceanside beaches saw more than 4 million visitors.

Wilson calmly reassured the individual, guiding them back to safety while keeping them afloat. Once they reached the shore, he immediately called for medical assistance, ensuring the swimmer received the care they needed.\n\nThe community gathered to celebrate Wilson\u2019s bravery, recognizing not just his quick response but also his unwavering commitment to the safety of others. \u201cI was just doing my job,\u201d Wilson humbly stated during the ceremony, but to many, he is a true hero, embodying the spirit of service and courage that lifeguards represent."}

{"text":"By LAURIE KELLMAN\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The nation\u2019s political leaders bowed their heads for a solemn salute Wednesday to the Rev. Billy Graham in the soaring Capitol Rotunda, paying tribute to a man who ministered to presidents and other Americans of both parties.\n\u201cHere lies America\u2019s pastor,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan, gesturing to Graham\u2019s casket under the eye of the dome, surrounded by family, friends, lawmakers and a ring of paintings of the nation\u2019s founders. \u201cHe ministered to all walks, from some of the greats whose statues line this hall_Eisenhower, King, Ford, and Reagan_to the everyday citizens lining up today to pay their respects.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump said his father was an admirer of Graham\u2019s and that the \u201clegendary\u201d American figure deserved to be recognized in the place \u201cwhere the memory of the American people is enshrined.\u201d\nGraham\u2019s influence stretched far beyond the city where he counseled lawmakers to a global flock over the better part of seven decades.\n\u201cThe man we recognize today shared the Gospel with more people, face-to-face, than anyone else in history,\u201d said Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\nAs the leaders stood by the casket, Trump reached out to touch the bare wood and Ryan bowed his head.\nGraham died a week earlier at age 99. Some 30 family members are accompanying Graham\u2019s casket to Washington, where he befriended presidents of both parties and counseled others over seven decades. Graham\u2019s son, Franklin, tweeted a photo Wednesday of family members loading the casket onto a jet emblazoned with \u201cSamaritan\u2019s Purse,\u201d the name of a Christian relief charity that he chairs.\nGraham is lying in honor before a funeral Friday near his home in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Rotunda entrances were draped with black fabric, and Graham\u2019s casket rested on a black-draped catafalque beneath the soaring ceiling and its painting, the \u201cApotheosis of Washington.\u201d\nThough he met every president since Harry Truman and counseled most, Graham grew wary of politics after Watergate. He was closest to Richard Nixon but later said he felt used by him.\nNonetheless, Graham ministered to other presidents until his health began to fail about 10 years ago.\nFormer President Bill Clinton recalled seeing one of Graham\u2019s crusades as a child, a profound experience that became more amazing over his life. Graham counseled him as Arkansas governor, and later as president in the White House itself.\n\u201cIn that little room, he was the same person I saw when I was 11 on that football field,\u201d Clinton said Tuesday after viewing the casket at Graham\u2019s home.\nFormer President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, also visited Graham\u2019s home on Tuesday.\nIn Washington, Ryan said there had been no doubt that Graham would receive the honor of a public viewing in the Rotunda. He told reporters that almost immediately upon hearing of Graham\u2019s death he, Trump, McConnell and Rep. Patrick McHenry, who represents the Graham family\u2019s district, agreed it would happen.\nGraham shares the honor with 11 presidents and other distinguished Americans, starting with Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky in 1852 and, most recently, Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii in 2012, according to the House and the Architect of the Capitol.\nGraham is only the fourth private person to lie in honor since 1998. The others are two U.S. Capitol Police officers who died in the line of duty in 1998 and civil rights hero Rosa Parks in 2005.\nTrump met Graham at the pastor\u2019s 95th birthday party in 2013, but is closer to Franklin Graham Jr.\nOn Friday, Trump was to attend Graham\u2019s funeral near his library in Charlotte, North Carolina. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush will not be there, meaning no former presidents will attend the funeral.\nFollow Kellman at http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/APLaurieKellman","generate":"...a man whose influence transcended the pulpit and touched millions of lives. Graham, who passed away at the age of 99, was remembered not only for his powerful sermons but also for his unwavering commitment to spreading a message of hope and love. \n\nAs lawmakers, dignitaries, and citizens gathered, stories of his kindness and compassion echoed through the hall. Many recalled how he bridged divides, offering solace and guidance during times of national crisis. His ability to connect with people from all walks of life was a testament to his belief in the inherent dignity of every individual.\n\nIn a poignant moment, family members shared personal reflections, highlighting his role as a father and mentor.

{"text":"Britain\u2019s red carpet night for the stars of the silver screen took place last night at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in attendance at the 70th edition of the BAFTAs. This was the first time the royal couple have been together on this red carpet, turning up the heat on the jewellery front, and Kate didn\u2019t disappoint. Confirming the red-carpet trend, Kate chose large earrings over a statement necklace worn with her off-the shoulder floral print gown by Alexander McQueen.\nThe Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s large chandelier earrings have us all guessing. According to the Daily Mail, Kensington Palace will not comment on whether they were a loan or from the Duchess\u2019 own jewellery box, but they have had previous outings. Our hunch is that the jewels are by a British designer and that the pink stones are morganites \u2013 the Duchess has shown a preference for pastel-coloured gems \u2013 surrounded by old-cut diamonds.\nThese classic yet so very Kate earrings were possibly commissioned by the Duchess herself, but no jeweller worth her commission would dare to spill the beans, so we will just have to keep guessing. The articulated diamond bracelet looks like it might be an Art Deco jewel from the Queen\u2019s personal collection. She was, of course, wearing her sapphire engagement ring.\nBeyond the excitement caused by the Duchess of Cambridge, bold embroidered floral motifs on gowns were the main couture trend, dominated by Alexander McQueen, Gucci, Dior and Tom Ford. With embellished dresses a strong style statement, glamorous earrings to complement the decorative flourishes as opposed to showstopper necklaces marked the night.\nAfter the Duchess of Cambridge, Emily Blunt was the most polished example of how to pair an elaborate gown with jewels. She wore her Alexander McQueen gown with Lorraine Schwartz jewels. In her lobes were a pair of 50-carat blue sapphire earrings and on her finger, a playful, lifesize, lifelike dragonfly ring that looked as if it had just fluttered out from the Oriental garden embroidered on her dress.\nBulgari picked a winner as Viola Davis, below, raised her prize for Best Supporting Actress wearing a diamond Serpenti bracelet coiling up her arm and matching earrings along with her striped, flowing chiffon Jenny Peckham gown.

French actress Isabelle Huppert also wore Chopard, with 68 carats of emeralds and 14 carats of diamonds in her lobes alone.\nIsabelle Huppert\u2019s BAFTAs jewels included these shoulder-grazing Chopard high jewellery emerald earrings, which feature diamond stars raining down from both ears.\nStar Wars heroine Daisy Ridley, below, scrubbed up and shone in chic Roland Mouret, paired with a bold yet simple Cartier Nouvelle Vague black lacquer and diamond cuff and two pairs of diamond earrings in her ears.\nStar Wars heroine Daisy Ridley shone in chic Roland Mouret, paired with a bold yet simple Cartier Nouvelle Vague black lacquer and diamond cuff and two pairs of diamond earrings in her ears.\nWith each publication, JK Rowling grows ever more glamorous and looked a true celebrity on the red carpet in her deep-pink, floor-sweeping Roland Mouret gown.

(Photo: Michael Chow\/azcentral sports)\nAs anyone with 175 career games under his belt surely knows, nothing lasts forever. Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer knows he isn\u2019t getting any younger.\nThe veteran had most of his best years with the Bengals but, after a trade from Oakland to Arizona in 2013, he led the Cardinals to a 10-6 season \u2014 their best record since 2009.\nHe posted a 63.3 completion percentage for 4,274 yards, his best passing efficiency since 2007 (64.9 percent) and a then-career high in single-season passing yards.\nMORE: Bickley: Cardinals' Carson Palmer can't wait for his last shot\nPalmer suffered a torn ACL that derailed his 2014 season but Palmer was better than ever in 2015.\nThe veteran set career highs in wins (13), passing yards (4,671), yards per attempt (8.7) and QBR (78.6). Pro Football Focus named him a first-team All Pro; Palmer had never been named to any all-pro team by any publication.\nHowever, the 37-year-old quarterback experienced a clear decline in performance in 2016, posting career lows since his time in Oakland in categories across the board.\nCardinals coach Bruce Arians talks with Carson Palmer (3) during a game against Washington on Dec. 4. (Photo: Michael Chow\/azcentral sports)\nThe drop-off has called into question Palmer\u2019s chances for a bounce-back season.\n\u201cI feel great. My body feels great like everybody in the league right now,\u201d Palmer said in a conference call on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m excited about this year, this group and the opportunity in front of us.\u201d\nFor Palmer, feeling is everything. For a player fifth among active quarterbacks in sack percentage (5 percent), it\u2019s important to apply regular oversight to his health.\nIn fact, Palmer has been performing his yearly self-checkup since before his breakout 2015 campaign. The inflated numbers were nice to have, but it didn\u2019t change how he viewed the rest of his career.\nMORE: Cardinals' Carson Palmer says age is relative at QB position\n\u201cI\u2019ve been telling my wife (for years) that this is the last one, but I take it one year at a time,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cI go through a process at end of the season to take stock.\u201d\nWith lower expectations and an optimistic mindset, Palmer is looking to get back to doing what he loves \u2014 just playing the game.\n\u201cI love the game, working out, studying, every facet of it,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cAs long as I have the ability and the health to play, and continue to enjoy it, I don\u2019t want to stop.\u201d\nThe underdog\nPalmer believes the Cardinals\u2019 7-8-1 record in 2016 could be the best thing to happen to the team \u2014 and to him.\nIt\u2019s an interesting disposition, especially considering that just a season prior the Cardinals claimed their first NFC West title since 2009 and won 13 games for the first time in franchise history. They also earned a first-round bye in the playoffs, another first for Arizona.\nThe Palmer-led Cardinals made a statement with a 26-20 overtime win over the Green Bay Packers in the divisional round at University of Phoenix Stadium, but could not contain Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers in a 49-15 road drubbing in the NFC title game.\nMORE: Cardinals had more fun this spring, Bruce Arians says\nStill, expectations remained high for the Cardinals entering 2016.\nThis, Palmer maintains, spelled doom for him and his teammates. But this year, the 14-year veteran signal caller is looking forward to being in a familiar role.\n\u201cI prefer the underdog role, and people are talking about other teams this year,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cIt allows you to go about your work, not having to answer some questions that come with a 13-3 season.\u201d\nPalmer can feel the difference.\n\u201cI think there is definitely (less pressure),\u201d Palmer said. \u201cComing off a below .500 season, it gives you a little more time to focus on your craft, doing your job, and I think our team prefers the underdog style as well.\u201d\nMORE: Carson Palmer on NFL's highest paid player list","generate":"...Somers and Bob McManaman discussed the latest updates on the Arizona Cardinals as they prepare for their upcoming matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles.

{"text":"The second-quarter earnings season has been hailed by Wall Street\u2019s equity bulls, who point to the better-than-expected results as proof that the stock market\u2019s lofty levels were justified by the rise of activity in U.S. corporations.\nS&P earnings grew 11% in the second quarter, the second straight quarter of double-digit growth, according to data from Goldman Sachs, the fastest two quarters of growth since 2011. More than half of S&P companies topped forecasts, the highest percentage since the second quarter of 2010, although the average upside surprise was 4%, slightly below the long-term average of 5%.\nDespite the strength in the quarter, results in the first half of the year \u201chave not been strong enough to warrant positive S&P 500 [earnings per share] revisions,\u201d Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients. Of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 primary sectors, it noted, forecasts for 2018\u2019s profits have come down for six of them.\nThe average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet see S&P 500 SPX, +1.00% earnings of $141.81 a share in 2018. That\u2019s down 0.2% from the $142.15 a share estimate that was forecast at the end of June.\nForecasts have come down even more for the remainder of the current year. For 2017, analysts see earnings of $130.46 a share for the S&P 500. That\u2019s down 3.5% from the $135.25 that was forecast at the end of April. The S&P has risen 3.5% since that date.\nIt isn\u2019t uncommon for estimates to be pared back as analysts and investors get more clarity about what economic conditions will look like, and the current tapering of expectations is less severe than is typical. The 0.2% decline for 2018 earnings is narrower than the 2% reduction that is typical when investors look out to the coming year, while the view for the second half of the year is also milder. Whereas forecasts have come down by 4% since March, per Goldman, the 30-year average reduction in estimates is 9%.\nOpinion: The charts say S&P is heading into a \u2018treacherous\u2019 pullback\nDespite that, the investment bank\u2014led by chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin\u2014expects 2018 forecasts to drop 5% from current levels. In particular, it wrote that the market consensus was \u201coverly optimistic primarily on energy earnings growth.\u201d\nEven though major U.S. stock-market indexes rose throughout the second-quarter earnings season, with both the Dow DJIA, +0.62% and the Nasdaq COMP, +1.34% hitting records, there were signs that investors were unimpressed even with better-than-expected results in the quarter.\nAccording to data from BlackRock, U.S. companies that topped consensus forecasts on both earnings and sales barely rose in the day after their earnings, relative to their benchmark. In the first quarter, such companies outperformed by nearly 1%, in aggregate.\nIn comparison, stocks from Europe, Japan, or emerging markets that posted better-than-expected results saw much more pronounced rises in the second quarter. Meanwhile, U.S. companies that just missed on revenue sold off more than stocks from other regions that did, while the names that reported worse-than-expected results on both metrics were sharply punished following the results.\n\u201cEquity markets have greeted positive earnings reports largely with indifference. Investor sentiment shows more signs of fatigue than euphoria, even as stock markets have repeatedly reached new highs this year,\u201d said Richard Turnill, BlackRock\u2019s global chief investment strategist.\nInvestors \u201cmay be on to something,\u201d he added. \u201cIt will be more difficult for companies to achieve the same EPS growth in the second half, as the earnings recovery in the second half of 2016 is a higher hurdle.\u201d\nDespite that, he forecast \u201csolid fundamentals and returns\u201d going forward, \u201cwith the latter largely tracking earnings growth.\u201d","generate":"...resilience of corporate America. Many companies have reported strong revenue growth, driven by robust consumer spending and effective cost management strategies. This has instilled a sense of optimism among investors, who are eager to see if this momentum can be sustained in the coming months.\n\nHowever, not all sectors have shared in this success. Some industries, particularly those heavily reliant on supply chains, continue to face challenges that could dampen future performance. Analysts are closely monitoring these trends, as they could impact overall market stability.\n\nDespite these concerns, the prevailing sentiment remains one of cautious optimism. Investors are encouraged by the adaptability of businesses in navigating a complex economic landscape. As the earnings season unfolds, many are hopeful that the positive surprises will continue, reinforcing confidence in the market's ability to weather potential storms ahead. The focus now shifts to how companies will manage inflationary pressures and evolving consumer preferences in the second half of the year."}

Opportunities like these don\u2019t come without the support and encouragement from my family, Coach Cal, the coaching staff, my teammates, and of course, the fans.\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed every moment of this journey at the University of Kentucky and I just want to thank everyone for who has supported me through both my ups and my downs. Lord knows this hasn\u2019t been easy, but my time here has only better prepared me for what the future has for me.\n\u201cAfter receiving positive feedback, my dreams of becoming a professional basketball player are that much closer to reality.

He shot 39.6 percent (42-for-106) from 3-point range and led the Wildcats with 40 blocked shots.\nIt's NBA draft decision day: Will these UK players return next season?\nYou may like: John Calipari talking to NBA teams about UK players testing out draft\nAlso: PJ Washington withdraws from NBA draft and will return to Kentucky\nThe highlight of Gabriel's season came in the SEC Tournament semifinals when he hit all 7 of his 3-point attempts en route to a team-high 23 points in a win over Alabama.\n\"Wenyen\u2019s game is where the league continues to trend towards,\u201d UK head coach John Calipari said in a news release confirming the decision. \u201cHe\u2019s a position-less big man who can shoot, guard multiple positions and is willing to do what it takes to win. Wenyen grew so much from his freshman season to his sophomore year. If he continues to make those same strides, he\u2019s going to carve himself a role with a team. He and I have talked and he knows he\u2019s going to have to work hard to get there, but I\u2019m confident he can.\u201d\nSince the end of the season, UK has lost Kevin Knox, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Hamidou Diallo to the draft and Sacha Killeya-Jones and Tai Wynyard to transfers.\nFreshman forward PJ Washington announced he was returning to UK earlier Wednesday, and multiple national reports suggested the Wildcats could add Stanford graduate transfer Reid Travis to next season's roster.\nBoth Washington and Travis play Gabriel's position. UK also will feature 2017-18 starter Nick Richards and five-star recruit EJ Montgomery in the post positions, clogging the path to the number of minutes Gabriel might have needed to improve his stock.\nAt the combine earlier this month, Calipari said he had talked with multiple teams that had worked out Gabriel.\n\"One team told me yes, the other team told me no,\" Calipari said. \"But the good news about this league: You only have to have one team that likes you. The other 29 can say you stink, but if that one likes you, they take you.\"\nGabriel seems likely to start his professional career overseas or in the NBA's developmental league.\nTravis will be a fifth-year senior next season. His addition would ensure Kentucky does not play a second consecutive season without a scholarship junior or senior, but for now Washington, Richards and point guard Quade Green, each entering their second season at Kentucky, are the most experienced scholarship players on the roster.\nJon Hale: jahale@courier-journal.com; Twitter: @JonHale_CJ.

{"text":"BEIJING, May 31 (Reuters) - China's vast manufacturing sector grew at the fastest pace in eight months in May, blowing past expectations and easing concerns about an economic slowdown even as risks from trade tensions with the United States and a crackdown on debt point to a bumpy ride ahead.\nThe official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Thursday rose to 51.9 in May, from 51.4 in April, and remained well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the 22nd straight month.\nAnalysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the reading would dip slightly to 51.3.\nProduction expanded at the fastest rate in six months in May while growth in new orders rose to an 8-month high, helped by rising commodities prices.\nThe strong manufacturing sector readings defy concerns about an expected loss of momentum in the world's second-biggest economy, as policymakers navigate debt risks and rocky trade relations with the United States.\nIn particular, export orders improved from the previous month. Some economists suspect that Chinese firms have been front-loading shipments due to the Sino-U.S. trade frictions.\nOn the whole, however, economists were sceptical of the sustainability of industrial sector strength, suggesting the broader economy will face pressure over coming months.\n\"We doubt this strength will be sustained for long given that it appears to mostly reflect a temporary boost to industrial output from the easing of pollution controls rather than a turnaround in underlying demand,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, in a note after the data release.\nNomura analysts were also of the view the strong PMI readings will be short-lived, saying \"the growth of end-demand, such as infrastructure and property investment, has slumped in recent months, due at least in part to the government\u00b4s deleveraging efforts.\"\nSMALL FIRMS FACE FUNDING PRESSURES\nBeijing has been tightening controls on riskier investments, the shadow banking business and speculation in the property sector, but has been keen to keep the broad economy well funded.\nThe industrial sector, a key source of jobs, remained in healthy shape, with profits growing at their fastest pace in six months, underpinned by continued strength in the steel sector.\nBut the latest survey showed that more manufacturers were concerned about tightening in funding over recent months, with 40.1 percent of all firms polled raising the issue in May, according to Zhao Qinghe, an official with the statistics bureau.\n\"Big cost pressure is still one of the major problems facing Chinese manufacturers these days,\" said Zhao.\nActivity of small firms contracted in May after expanding the previous month while both big and medium-sized companies all posted positive growth.\nHi-tech manufacturing activity rose to 54.8 in May, up from April's 53.8, despite pending U.S. tariff list under its intellectual property probe and restrictions on Chinese investments in the U.S.\nWashington said on Tuesday that it was moving forward with its threat to apply tariffs on Chinese imports worth up to $50 billion, reviving fresh worries of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Trade tensions had ebbed only recently after Beijing pledged to buy more from the United States.\nChina's economy grew at a slightly faster-than-expected pace of 6.8 percent in the first quarter. However, signs of stress were evident with investment growth slowing to a near 20-year low in April and growth in retail sales sliding.\nBoosted by government infrastructure spending, a resilient housing market and unexpected strength in exports, China's manufacturers helped the economy deliver strong growth last year.\nEconomists still expect China's economic growth to slow to 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017, citing rising borrowing costs, tougher limits on industrial pollution and a crackdown on local governments' spending to keep their debt levels in check.\nA sister survey showed growth in China's service sector also picked up pace in May, with the official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edging up to 54.9 from 54.8 the previous month.\nA sub-reading for construction activity, a major driver of growth in 2017, stood at 60.1 in May, down from 60.6 in April.\nChinese policymakers are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports. The services sector now accounts for over half of the economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending clout.\nA composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services activity rose to 54.6 in May, from April's 54.1.\n(Reporting by Stella Qiu and Ryan Woo Editing by Shri Navaratnam)","generate":"...as the country navigates the challenges posed by global uncertainties. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 52.0 in May, up from 50.6 in April, indicating robust expansion in manufacturing activity. Analysts had anticipated a more modest increase, reflecting a surge in demand both domestically and internationally.\n\nThis growth is a hopeful sign for the Chinese economy, which has faced headwinds from trade tensions and the lingering effects of the pandemic. Factories reported increased output and new orders, suggesting that consumer confidence is gradually returning. Additionally, the easing of COVID-19 restrictions has allowed businesses to operate more freely, contributing to the positive momentum.\n\nWhile challenges remain, including rising raw material costs and supply chain disruptions, the latest data offers a glimpse of resilience. Policymakers are likely to take this as a cue to continue supporting the economy, ensuring that the recovery remains on track as the world looks to China for stability in the manufacturing sector."}

{"text":"It turns out, the oyster aphrodisiac myth not be a myth at all. You may have heard that they'll get you in the mood because oysters are high in zinc, which is linked to high testosterone levels and in rats. I've also heard it's because eating an oyster is similar to giving oral sex to a woman, which I don't understand because I've definitely never done that in a Red Lobster. But as far as oysters leading to sex is concerned, there may be science to back this idea up.\nNew research from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which looked at data of 501 couples who were trying to get pregnant, shows that eating seafood is linked to having more sex \u2014 and higher pregnancy rates. They study went on for four years, where couples were each followed for one year or until pregnancy was detected. And the results were clear \u2014 more seafood intake was associated with having more sex and fecundity \u2014 which essentially just means fertility or the ability to produce offspring. Say it with me: fecundity. More seafood, higher fecundity.\nBasically, the research found that 92 percent of the couples who ate fish and shellfish at least twice a week were able to get pregnant within the year. They also found that those who ate the most fish and shellfish \u2014 to the tune of eight or more times a month \u2014 had a 22 percent higher rate of sexual activity than average. So if you're trying to get pregnant \u2014 or just have more sex life \u2014 you may want to pass the lobster.\nThe researchers actually didn't set out to prove the link between seafood and sexual intercourse, so the results were a shock to them too. \"We are not sure what exactly is driving this association,\" Audrey J. Gaskins, Sc.D., Research Associate at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, tells Bustle. \"For example, the original reason why shellfish such as oysters were linked to increased libido was due to their high zinc content. Studies have shown that in humans, dietary zinc intake has a positive correlation with testosterone levels and in rats that zinc therapy improves sexual competence. However, given that we did not measure zinc intake in our study and zinc is found in many other foods other than seafood, we felt uncomfortable making this link in our study.\"\nGaskin also says there's a possible behavioral explanation for the link. \"It is also possible that couples who consume higher amounts of seafood together share more meals and thus more time together (including nights) which may be a behavioral explanation for the association we observed with sexual activity,\" she says.\nSo now you know. But that's not the first time a link between food and sex has been proven. Take a look at some of the connections below.\n1 Millennials Like Food As Much As Sex Andrew Zaeh for Bustle In 2016, a survey from Havas Worldwide and Market Probe International, of almost 12,000 adults of all ages, found that 54 percent of millennials believed that food is on the same level as sex. Millennials are far more likely to put food that high on the list than other generations \u2014 as only 42 percent of Baby Boomers said the same.\n2 Guacamole Can Help You Hook Up Andrew Zaeh for Bustle Whether you're looking for love or sex, certain foods can help you get there. Zoosk, the dating platform, looked at 3,733,185 dating profiles and 364,609,566 first messages and found that food was often associated with a higher response rate. For example, mentioning guacamole in a message got you 114 percent more replies than not mentioning it. It really is the way to our hearts \u2014 and our everything else.\n3 An Apple A Day Can Help Your Roll In The Hay Andrew Zaeh for Bustle This is one reason to get your five-a-day. Research published in the journal of Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics found that apples can actually stimulate sexual arousal in women. The research found that apples can improve lubrication and overall sexual function. Just something to keep in mind the next time you're at the grocery store.\n4 Men And Women Think About Sex More Than Food Andrew Zaeh for Bustle A 2011 study from psychologists at Ohio University found that women think about sex about once every 50 minutes, compared to men who think about it every 28 minutes. When it comes to food, women think about it every 62 minutes \u2014 while men tended to think about it every 38 minutes. So let me get this straight: Some women think about food less than once an hour? The average woman does? I have never met any of these women. I want to take my own poll about how many seconds pass between me thinking about bread. If I can get the number up to 20, I win.","generate":"...which plays a crucial role in testosterone production and overall reproductive health. Recent studies suggest that the connection between oysters and increased libido may have some scientific backing. Zinc is essential for the production of sperm and can enhance sexual function, making oysters a potential natural booster for those looking to spice up their romantic lives.\n\nMoreover, oysters are rich in amino acids that can trigger the production of sex hormones, further supporting the idea that these shellfish might indeed have aphrodisiac properties. Beyond their physical benefits, the experience of enjoying oysters\u2014often associated with luxury and indulgence\u2014can also create a romantic atmosphere, enhancing the mood in its own right.\n\nSo, whether you\u2019re planning a special dinner or simply want to enjoy a treat, consider adding oysters to your menu. They might just be the perfect ingredient for a night of passion, blending both taste and potential benefits in one delightful package."}

REUTERS\/Olivia Harris\nSINGAPORE Malaysia's Petronas has pitched an estimated $1 billion stake in a prized upstream local gas project to potential bidders including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N), Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP.BK) and Japanese firms, sources familiar with the matter said.\nIf successful, the deal could mark Petronas' biggest upstream stake sale since oil prices started declining more than two years ago. Petronas is targeting lowering operating expenses, job cuts and project rollbacks to help it navigate through the low oil price environment.\nCiting sources, Reuters reported in February that Petronas was considering selling a stake of as much as 49 percent in the SK316 offshore gas block in Malaysia's Sarawak state.\nThe state-owned oil and gas company has approached about a dozen prospective buyers including global oil majors and Asian firms focussed on Southeast Asia, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the talks are private.\nThey said Petronas has begun providing financial and operational data to the companies and expects to receive bids over the next few weeks.\n\"It's just what the environment is. Nobody wants to keep all the risk on their books,\" said Vikas Halan, senior credit officer, corporate finance group at Moody's, adding he viewed the move as a rebalancing of Petronas' portfolio.\n\"Petronas is the leader in the oil and gas space, especially on the gas side. The experience of getting or producing LNG and marketing LNG is quite an interesting one and Petronas becomes a logical choice for players,\" he said.\nIn a statement to Reuters, Petronas said that through its subsidiary, Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, it is looking for partners who can bring the technology and capabilities to explore, develop and efficiently operate the various fields and opportunities in the SK316 offshore gas block.\n\"We are confident that we will attract the right partners to maximise the potential value of these opportunities to help meet the world's growing oil and gas demand,\" Petronas said.\nIt was not immediately known what the individual companies' response to Petronas' approach was.\nOne financial source said a minority stake might not appeal to non-Asian oil majors but a decision to bid would depend on details of the stake being offered, valuations and the potential for long term partnerships with Petronas.\nExxonMobil declined to comment, while Shell referred the query to Petronas. A spokeswoman for PTTEP declined to comment on the deal but said the company was keen to invest in Southeast Asia because it had expertise in the region where costs and risks were low.\nGas from the NC3 field in the SK316 block feeds Malaysia's LNG export project, known as LNG 9, Petronas' joint venture with JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp (5020.T) that began commercial production in January.\nPetronas could use the funds from the stake sale to develop the Kasawari field in the same block. The field is one of the largest non-associated gas fields in Malaysia and has an estimated recoverable hydrocarbon resource of about three trillion standard cubic feet.\n\"Kasawari will require a significant capital investment to develop due to the high CO2 content,\" said Prasanth Kakaraparthi, senior upstream research analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.\n\"In a lower-for-longer oil price world, it makes commercial sense for Petronas to farm down its interest and partner with companies that have innovative CO2 handling technology,\" he said.\nPetronas put on hold plans to develop the field in 2015 after oil and gas prices fell, according to media reports.\n(Reporting by Anshuman Daga and Gloystein Henning in SINGAPORE; Additional reporting by A. Ananthalakshmi in KUALA LUMPUR, Jessica Jaganathan in SINGAPORE, Satawasin Staporncharnchai in BANGKOK; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)","generate":"...Petronas has announced plans to expand its operations in Southeast Asia, aiming to enhance its market presence and meet the growing energy demands of the region.

Recent rain and snow, and the forecast for continued precipitation, help to suppress the fires and provide welcome relief for Montana residents.\nFires aren't too uncommon in Montana, but this year's fire season has been different. Spring brought plenty of moisture from an abundant snow-pack and provided adequate moisture for grass growth. The moisture quickly depleting leaving most of the state in drought condition.\n\"Ranchers saw this as great grass and feed. Firefighters saw it as fuel,\" said Dennis Garcia, Farm Service Agency (FSA) county executive director for Glacier County, Montana. Garcia was activated to serve in the National Guard during the wildfire suppression efforts near Lolo, Montana.\nFSA provides assistance to farmers and ranchers who have been impacted by natural disasters, including wildfires, by administering a suite of safety-net programs to help producers recover from eligible losses, such as the Livestock Indemnity Program, the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program, and the Tree Assistance Program. The programs can assist farmers and ranchers who lost livestock, grazing land, fences or eligible trees, bushes and vines as a result of the qualifying natural disaster.\nThe Lolo Peak Fire, southwest of Lolo, Montana, has impacted over 53,000 acres. The National Guard was activated to help with evacuation efforts near the wildfire.\nIn addition, the FSA Emergency Conservation Program provides funding and technical assistance for farmers and ranchers to rehabilitate farmland damaged by natural disasters. Low-interest emergency loans are available to help producers recover from production and physical losses. Compensation is also available to producers who purchased coverage through the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, which protects non-insurable crops (including native grass for grazing) against natural disasters that result in lower yields, crop losses or prevented planting.\nRecommended Stories For You\nAs a result of the ongoing drought conditions, all Montana counties were approved for emergency haying and grazing of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres.

Producers can get some relief, fix fences and get feed purchased,\" Garcia said.\nGarcia said hay donations came into the state from other areas to help out ranchers in need. Additionally, FSA employees from other states, including Missouri and Oklahoma, have spent time helping Montana producers enroll in FSA disaster programs.\n\"It is proof that the agriculture community is one big small town where you have a lot of folks that have camaraderie,\" he said.\nDetailed information on all of these disaster assistance programs can be found online at: http:\/\/www.fsa.usda.gov\/disaster.

{"text":"ROME (Reuters) - An Italian man opened fire on African migrants in the central city of Macerata on Saturday, injuring six people before he was captured, in what police said was a racially motivated attack.\nThe shootings happened just days after a Nigerian migrant was arrested in connection with the death of an 18-year-old Italian woman, whose dismembered body was discovered stuffed into two suitcases near Macerata.\nPolice named the suspected shooter as Luca Traini, 28, and said he had an Italian flag draped over his shoulders when he was seized in the street by armed police. Onlookers said he made a fascist salute before being handcuffed.\n\u201cHe drove around in his car and when he saw any black people he shot them,\u201d Marcello Mancini, a Macerata resident, told Reuters television. Police said one of the six victims was seriously hurt and needed surgery, but gave no further details.\nTraini also fired shots at the offices of the ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD) in Macerata, but did not injure anyone there. The PD said he had stood as a candidate for the rightist Northern League at local elections last year but had not received any votes.\nThe League backs fiercely anti-immigrant policies and is part of ex-prime Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s center-right alliance that is leading in the polls ahead of a March 4 national election.\nLeague leader Matteo Salvini distanced himself from the shooting, but blamed mass immigration for the tensions.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get into government to restore security, social justice and serenity to Italy,\u201d he told reporters.\nPD leader Matteo Renzi called for calm.\n\u201cThe man who fired the gun, hitting six people of color, is a squalid, mad person.

{"text":"A&M\u2019s first-round draft streak hangs in balance with WR Christian Kirk\nPhoto: Rodolfo Gonzalez \/ For The Washington Post Christian Kirk will try to continue a trend of Texas A&M...\nCOLLEGE STATION \u2014 Texas A&M has had at minimum one first-round selection in every NFL draft since 2011. So at least one good thing for the Aggies came out of receiver Christian Kirk bypassing his senior season for the draft \u2014 he\u2019s A&M\u2019s best hope of keeping the streak alive.\n\u201cI\u2019d be wrong if I said it didn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Kirk said of perhaps becoming A&M\u2019s 10th first-round choice in the past eight drafts. \u201cIt definitely means a lot, to be able to carry on that tradition. And that\u2019s every kid\u2019s dream, to be able to go to college, have a very successful career, be a first-round draft pick and walk across that stage.\u201d\nThe draft, which starts Thursday night, is being held at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, and Kirk plans to be at home in Arizona. So even if he is a first-round selection, he won\u2019t be walking across a stage to greet NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.\nIn an odd twist to the 2018 draft, the No. 1 overall selection likely will be in Arlington for a second consecutive year. A year ago A&M\u2019s lone No. 1 overall pick in NFL history, defensive end Myles Garrett, chose to stay in his hometown of Arlington and celebrate his selection with family and friends.\nTranslator To read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below. College Sports\nKirk, praised for his discipline and no-nonsense approach on and off the field, projects as a fringe first-round pick. USA Today this week listed him as the fourth-best receiver in the draft, behind Alabama\u2019s Calvin Ridley, Maryland\u2019s DJ Moore and Memphis\u2019s Anthony Miller. That designation also pushed Kirk out of the first round, with only Ridley and Moore projected in the first.\nWatts, Ratley possible picks\nA&M safety Armani Watts forecasts as a mid-round choice, and the only other Aggie who might be selected is swift receiver Damion Ratley in the late rounds.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been one of the better leaders here these past few years,\u201d Watts said when asked what he will bring to an NFL club. \u201cI just have a drive for football.\u201d\nThat was evident time and again over his four-year career, as Watts made game-saving interceptions against Arkansas and Tennessee along the way, and multiple clutch plays late in Southeastern Conference contests.\n\u201cThat really comes with preparation before the game and a lot of film study and good practice habits,\u201d Watts said. \u201cJust knowing where to be at the right time and making the play when it comes.\u201d\nThe Aggies were especially young last season, with eight starters returning each on offense and defense in 2018. At one point during SEC play, 55 of the 82 players on A&M\u2019s traveling squad were underclassmen (freshmen or sophomores).\nA&M\u2019s 2013 and 2014 recruiting classes largely were busts under then-coach Kevin Sumlin, contributing to the Aggies\u2019 low number of potential draft picks. A&M had five players drafted in 2017, three in 2016 and two in 2015. All three of their selections in 2014 were first-round picks.\nA&M defensive tackle Zaycoven Henderson was arrested in December on three charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, tampering with evidence and possession of less than two ounces of marijuana.\nHenderson was suspended for A&M\u2019s bowl, and as he continues to wait to see what happens with his criminal case, he participated in the NFL combine in February but was not invited to A&M\u2019s annual pro day last month. He went from a possible mid-round selection to perhaps not being drafted at all based on the arrest and the pending status of the criminal case.\nA run of talent\nLinebacker Von Miller, who has developed into one of the NFL\u2019s top defenders, started the Aggies\u2019 string of first-round picks in 2011. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill, the oft-injured Miami Dolphins starter, followed in 2012, and offensive tackle Luke Joeckel made his mark in 2013.\nThe following year was especially fruitful for A&M, after offensive tackle Jake Matthews, receiver Mike Evans and quarterback Johnny Manziel all were first-round picks in 2014. Offensive tackle Cedric Ogbuehi followed in 2015, offensive tackle Germain Ifedi squeezed in as the 31st selection (out of 31 first-round picks) two years ago, and Garrett rounded out the nine prime picks in 2017.\nJoeckel and Miller were No. 2 overall choices, while Matthews, Evans and Tannehill also went in the top 10 (and with Garrett at No. 1).\nThe first round of the draft from Arlington is Thursday, while the second round and third rounds are Friday and the fourth through seventh rounds are Saturday.\nbrent.zwerneman@chron.com\ntwitter.com\/brentzwerneman","generate":"...producing first-round NFL draft picks.

Coaches and teammates praise his work ethic and leadership on and off the field, qualities that NFL scouts are sure to notice.\n\nWith the draft looming, Kirk remains focused, eager to showcase his talents and prove that he belongs among the elite.

{"text":"GETTY Families and friends have been urged to do more to reduce the risk of elderly people being neglected\nAround 500,000 UK pensioners are faced with violence or coercion each year, but cases can be hard to spot. As well as physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect, financial abuse can also have a significant adverse impact on victims\u2019 health and wellbeing. And greater awareness of the problem - including scam mail targeting and doorstep conmen \u2013 is needed to reduce the risk of older and disabled people being mistreated.\nResearch also shows that 53 per cent of older people believe they have been targeted by fraudsters and that a third of older people who responded to a scam may have lost \u00a31,000 or more. Older people defrauded in their homes are two-and-a-half times more likely to enter residential care within two years, compared to older people who are not victims of fraud. Fraudsters, including bogus doorstep callers and scam mail firms, often target older people whose health can suffer after falling victim to a scam, leading to extra costs on the health and social care sector, which could be prevented through earlier prevention and protection.\nThe rights of older and disabled people need to be protected Glen Garrod, Vice President of ADASS\nThe Association of Directors of Adult Social Services is calling for people to do more to look out for signs of abuse and to listen properly and act on any concerns. ADASS is also calling for a Government-funded recruitment campaign to help address high staff turnover and a reliance on agency staff, which leads to lack of continuity and to carers not knowing the person they are looking after.

The 16 year old has been suffering with severe depression for a few years, not being able to face brushing her hair and only getting up to go to the toilet. When she visited a salon her hair was a matted mass and she thought the only option was to shave it all off rather than face the pain of untangling it but her hairdresser had a better idea.\nWhen you're feeling low, how you look is the last thing on your mind and anyone who's ever experienced depression can sympathise with this Iowa teenager. The 16 year old had been suffering with severe depression when she visited her local hair salon in Waterloo, Iowa, ahead of her dreaded school portrait.

The 20-year-old student hairdresser recalled the tale, which she branded \"one of the hardest experiences\", in a moving Facebook post last week which has since been shared over 75K times, at the time of writing.\nInstead of chopping off the teenager's locks, Kayley took it upon herself to transform her look and give her back some of her self-worth and self-confidence which she'd lost to depression. She wrote: \"When she walked in she told us just cut it all off I can't deal with the pain of combing it out, she called herself worthless for it. It honestly broke my heart and we tried everything we could to keep this child's hair for her!\"\nThe girl - who Kayley wants to keep anonymous - confessed to the stylist that she felt so worthless, she couldn't be bothered to brush her hair which struck a chord with her. Rather than simply cut off the matted mass, Kayley selflessly spent 13 hours, over two days, untangling it before restyling her new shoulder-length haircut.\nLoading...\nShe added: \"At the end of the day I want this to be a lesson to people. MENTAL HEALTH is a thing, it effects people all around the world and of all ages!

After being here 8 hours yesterday and 5 hours today we finally made this beautiful girl smile and feel like she IS worth something!\"\nKayley was delighted to share that her client was pleased with the finished result, so much so, she told her: \"I will actually smile for my school's pictures today, you made me feel like me again.\"\nKayley's experience resonated with Facebook users with many sharing their own similar experiences in the comments while many others heaped praise on her for the selfless act.

But time, as I know only too well, marches relentlessly on; and the last Lockheed product which I flew in was an L1011 Tristar many years ago. In 1995, Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta to form Lockheed Martin, which is now a worldwide developer and builder of advanced military and space vehicles.\nLockheed Martin still has a facility in Burbank, which is a city of upwards of 100 000 residents in Los Angeles County in Southern California, 12 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. And younger people than I might already know that, because of its proximity to Hollywood, Burbank is home to companies such as the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), the Walt Disney Company and Warner Brothers, a circumstance which has earned the city the unofficial title \u2018Media Capital of the World.\u2019\nThe city of Burbank was named after a certain David Burbank, an entrepreneur who established a sheep ranch there in 1867. And what brought all of this into my mind was a series of associations which started with an entirely different American gentleman, a horticulturist who rejoiced in the name Luther Burbank; and Luther Burbank has his name \u2026 usually in pretty small print admittedly ... in horticultural handbooks because, in 1890, he cross-bred Leucanthemum vulgare \u2026 a name derived from two Greek words and one Latin one, meaning \u2018the common white flower\u2019 \u2026 with Leucanthemum maximum \u2026 \u2018the biggest white flower\u2019 \u2026 and cross-bred this hybrid plant with Leucanthemum lacustre \u2026 \u2018the outstanding white flower\u2019. The resulting Leucanthemum triple hybrid was then cross-bred with Nipponanthemum nipponicum \u2026 \u2018the Japanese daisy\u2019 \u2026 to produce a plant called Leucanthemum superbum \u2026 the superb white flower\u2019 \u2026which gardeners are most likely to recognise under its common name \u2013 Shasta daisy. (When dogs are allowed to cross-breed in a similar way, we call the resulting puppies \u2018mongrels\u2019: but when plant breeders cross different species we call the mongrel plants \u2018hybrids\u2019 and treat them as thoroughbreds.)\nThe Shasta daisy was named after Mount Shasta, a 14 000-plus foot non-active volcano at the southern end of the Cascade Range in Siskiyou County in California. Mount Shasta is high enough to have a snow-capped peak for most of the year, even in southern California; and the petals of the Shasta daisy are the colour of clean snow in the sunshine \u2013 a very bright white. With its bright yellow centre surrounded by bright, white petals, the Shasta daisy looks like, well, a very large daisy; and if you can recognise a daisy, you\u2019ll recognise a Shasta daisy when you see one. It is perennial \u2026 it will live for many years \u2026 in favourable conditions and is a favourite with gardeners worldwide, although some people find the scent of certain varieties quite unpleasant.\nAn undemanding plant, it is very happy in Scotland, which is not surprising when one knows that one of its grandparents \u2026 Leucanthemum vulgare \u2026 is better known by its common name of ox-eye daisy and grows wild throughout the British Isles and much of western Europe. Indeed, Shasta daisies are also happy to grow wild in Britain where they have \u2018escaped\u2019 from gardens. (I like the term \u2018garden escapees\u2019.) And yes, gentle reader, if you are wondering, my wife and I do have Shasta daisies in our own garden; and ox-eye daisies which \u2018escaped\u2019 from our garden thrive in the railway cutting behind our house.","generate":"...aviation giants. The spirit of innovation that once filled the air in Burbank is palpable, echoing through the stories of engineers and dreamers who dedicated their lives to pushing the boundaries of flight. Families gathered around their radios, captivated by the latest advancements, while children looked up in awe at the planes soaring overhead, their imaginations ignited by the possibilities of the skies.\n\nLockheed's legacy is woven into the fabric of the community, where the hum of aircraft engines became a familiar lullaby. The company not only shaped the landscape of aviation but also provided countless jobs, fostering a sense of pride among residents. Today, as we walk through the streets of Burbank, we can still feel the echoes of that industrious past, reminding us of the dreams that took flight and the people who dared to reach for the stars. The heart of aviation lives on, inspiring new generations to chase their own dreams."}

(Photo: AP) Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said Russia and China are pursuing entirely new nuclear capabilities tailored to achieve particular national security objectives while also modernising its conventional military, challenging traditional US military superiority. (Photo: AP)\nThe Trump administration has announced a new policy to modernise its nuclear arsenal by developing new smaller atomic bombs and enhancing its deterrence capabilities. The strategy, President Donald Trump said, is tailored and flexible to address the wide array of threats in the 21st century. \u201cIt pursues modernisation of our nuclear command, control, and communications, all three legs of our triad, our dual capable aircraft, and our nuclear infrastructure,\u201d said Trump after the the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) was out at the Pentagon.\nThe strategy develops capabilities aimed at making use of nuclear weapons less likely, he said, adding that it enhances deterrence of strategic attacks against the US, its allies and partners, that may not come in the form of nuclear weapons. \u201cAnd, importantly, it reaffirms our commitment to arms control and nuclear non-proliferation, maintains the moratorium on nuclear testing, and commits to improving efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to nuclear terrorism,\u201d Trump said.\nIn his preface to the new policy, that runs into 100 pages, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said maintaining an effective nuclear deterrent is much less expensive than fighting a war that the US was unable to deter. \u201cWhile we will be relentless in ensuring our nuclear capabilities are effective, the US is not turning away from its long-held arms control, non-proliferation, and nuclear security objectives,\u201d Mattis said.\n\u201cOur commitment to the goals of the treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) remains strong,\u201d he said. Mattis said Russia and China are pursuing entirely new nuclear capabilities tailored to achieve particular national security objectives while also modernising its conventional military, challenging traditional US military superiority. Russia, Mattis said, is modernising these weapons as well as its other strategic systems.\n\u201cEven more troubling has been Russia\u2019s adoption of military strategies and capabilities that rely on nuclear escalation for their success,\u201d said Mattis.\n\u201cThese developments, coupled with Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea and nuclear threats against our allies, mark Moscow\u2019s decided return to Great Power competition,\u201d he said. North Korea and Iran are the other two countries that figure in the report. There is no mention of Pakistan in the report, even as senior US officials in the past have expressed concerns over the security of nuclear weapons in the South Asian country.\n\u201cExpanding flexible US nuclear options now, to include low-yield options, is important for the preservation of credible deterrence against regional aggression,\u201d said the report as released by the Pentagon.\n\u201cIt will raise the nuclear threshold and help ensure that potential adversaries perceive no possible advantage in limited nuclear escalation, making nuclear employment less likely,\u201d the report said. The US will maintain, and enhance as necessary, the capability to forward deploy nuclear bombers and dual capability aircraft (DCA) around the world, it said.\nAdditionally, in the near-term, the US will modify a small number of existing SLBM warheads to provide a low-yield option, and in the longer term, pursue a modern nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM), the report said. For the longer term, the US will pursue a nuclear-armed SLCM, leveraging existing technologies to help ensure its cost effectiveness, according to the report.\n\u201cSLCM will provide a needed non-strategic regional presence, an assured response capability. It also will provide an arms control compliant response to Russia\u2019s non-compliance with the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, its non-strategic nuclear arsenal, and its other destabilising behaviours,\u201d the report said. The Nuclear report also said the US will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the NPT and in compliance with their nuclear nonproliferation obligations.\nFollowing the release of the report, US Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said the NPR makes sure the US remains flexible and well prepared for the unique threats it faces today. \u201cWe want to see a world that is free of nuclear weapons, but our nuclear policy needs to be rooted in the reality of the world we live in, where aggressive regimes like North Korea threaten us and our allies with their pursuit of illegal nuclear and ballistic weapons,\u201d said Haley.\n\u201cWhile we have continued to reduce the size of our nuclear arsenal, countries like Russia and China have moved in the opposite direction. The NPR appropriately addresses the nature of these threats and ensures that the safety and security of the American people remain our top priority,\u201d she said.\nIn a special briefing with reporters at the Pentagon, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Tom Shannon, said that in addition to China and Russia, other \u201cunfriendly regimes and enemies of the US put lives at risk by pursuing nuclear weapons\u201d.\n\u201cNorth Korea continues its illicit nuclear weapons programme and missile capabilities. Iran retains the technological capability to develop a nuclear weapon within one year of deciding to do so,\u201d Shannon said. He said that nuclear terrorism is still a major threat in the 21st century and countries need to work to mitigate it.\n\u201cThe potential threat of non-state actors getting their hands on a nuclear weapon remains at the front of all of our minds,\u201d Shannon said.\n\u201cBecause of the dangerous world we live in and our unwavering commitment to our allies, the 2018 NPR focuses on strengthening extended deterrence,\u201d he said. The US has formal extended deterrence commitments that assure European, Asian and Pacific allies of its commitment to use nuclear force to protect them, if necessary.\nOngoing, close collaboration with allies and partners is essential to deterring or defeating the common threats they face, said Shannon, noting that this collaboration includes sustained dialogues and joint military exercises.\n\u201cBut we also realise that every ally and partner faces a different threat environment. We will continue to work with them to tailor our assurance strategies in ways that are most effective for their specific situation,\u201d he said. Shannon said the US remains committed to the allies under its nuclear umbrella. \u201cOur extended deterrence commitments are unwavering. We have the ability and will to fulfil them. Potential adversaries should not doubt our resolve,\u201d Shannon said.\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App","generate":"...military dominance. In a recent address, Mattis emphasized the need for the United States to adapt its strategies in response to these evolving threats. He highlighted that both nations are investing heavily in advanced technologies, including hypersonic weapons and cyber capabilities, which could undermine the effectiveness of traditional deterrence strategies.\n\nMattis urged for a renewed focus on innovation and collaboration among allies to counter these developments. He stressed the importance of maintaining a robust defense posture while also engaging in diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions. The Defence Secretary acknowledged the complexities of modern warfare, where the lines between conventional and unconventional tactics are increasingly blurred.\n\nAs the global security landscape shifts, Mattis called for a comprehensive approach that not only strengthens military readiness but also fosters international partnerships.

Photo: Giuseppe Cacace \/ AFP\nThe German started from pole but was forced to switch to a one-stop strategy late in the race, requiring him to preserve his tyres against Bottas\u2019s fresher rubber.\nBut Vettel, racing in his 200th grand prix, used every ounce of his experience to fend off the quick-finishing Finn.\n\u201cI tell you, these tyres were done!\u201d Vettel shouted over team radio on the cool-down lap. \u201cThey were done for the last 10 laps!\n\u201cGrazie, ragazzi, mamma mia!\u201d\nThe strategic showdown between Ferrari and Mercedes was foreshadowed on Saturday (Apr 7), but Red Bull Racing was expected to figure strongly in race permutations; however, both Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen were eliminated from the race in the opening laps.\nRicciardo\u2019s car switched itself off on lap two with an electrical issue, whereas Verstappen picked up a puncture in a tangle with Hamilton on the opening lap.\nThough the Dutchman limped back to the pits for a tyre change, he sustained too much damage to his car in the process, and his team ordered his retirement on lap five.\nHamilton had lost a place to Fernando Alonso at the start, but a skirmish with the Spaniard and Nico Hulkenberg and Esteban Ocon on lap four put the Briton up to sixth, and decisive passes on Magnussen and Gasly on laps five and eight put the reigning world champion into fourth place.\nAt this stage the Briton was in the fight for victory with a potential tyre advantage, having started the race on the more enduring soft compound compared the supersoft used by the Vettel, Bottas and Kimi Raikkonen ahead.\nFerrari committed race leader Vettel and third-paced Raikkonen to two-stop races by pitting them for the soft-compound tyres on laps 18 and 19 respectively, prompting Mercedes to opt for the alternative one-stop strategy.\nBottas was the first silver car to pit, switching straight to the medium-compound tyre on lap 20.\nThe Ferrari drivers were required to push for the rest of the race to counter Mercedes\u2019s long-game approach, and Vettel duly obliged. By lap 27 he had re-passed Hamilton, who had inherited the lead, which prompted the Briton to make his sole pit stop for the medium compound.\nThe order resumed, with Vettel leading from Bottas, Raikkonen and Hamilton, and with 24 seconds required to make a pit stop, Mercedes ensured Lewis kept himself within 20 seconds of Sebastian at the head of the field.\nThe tension between the two opposing strategies escalated through to lap 35, when Ferrari blinked and stopped Raikkonen in an attempted to force Bottas to follow him, but the ploy backfired when the Finn left his pit box before his stop was completed, hitting a mechanic in the process.\nFerrari was forced to retire the car, losing a key strategic tool in the process.\nVettel was told he was being moved to strategy B, which meant he wouldn\u2019t be stopping again. The German switched to conservation mode to eke out the maximum life from his soft compound tyres.\nBottas seized his moment to strike. He began reeling in the scarlet car, and as Vettel\u2019s tyres began to expire in the final 10 laps, the Mercedes\u2019s rate of progress increased to a second a lap.\nWith five laps remaining little more than two seconds separated the race protagonists, and on the penultimate lap Bottas got within DRS range, closing in close enough to have a look down the inside at turn one.\nVettel, however, deftly fended off his advances, saving his battery power for deployment at key traction moments to counteract Bottas\u2019s superior grip.\nThe German led the Finn over the line by just 0.699 seconds.\n\u201cI think I came on the radio with 10 laps to go and said, \u2018I have everything under control\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that was a lie, I admit!

(AP) \u2014 California lawmakers on Tuesday revived a long-stalled proposal to set a goal of generating 100 percent of the state's energy from carbon-free sources.\nWith other controversial and high-stakes energy legislation also moving forward, California lawmakers face an array of decisions with vast implications for the Western energy grid, the future of renewable power and consumers' electric bills.\nA state legislative committee sent the 100 percent clean energy bill to the full Assembly, setting up a vote later this year.\nThe bill's revival is a tentative victory for its author, Democratic Sen. Kevin de Leon, who is waging an uphill battle to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein in the November election.\nDe Leon fought aggressively to push the bill forward in the final days of last year's legislative session but was unsuccessful.\nThe bill would bump up California's energy mandate, known as the renewable portfolio standard, from 50 percent to 60 percent by 2030. That energy would have to come from specific renewable resources including wind, solar, geothermal and small dams.\nIt would then set a goal of getting all remaining energy from resources that don't produce climate changing gases by 2045, leaving details of the plan to be hashed out later.\n\"This will put us on the pathway to clean renewable energy and economic growth for the future of California,\" de Leon said.\nCritics include business interests and utilities, which warn that industrial power users, like factories and food processors, and consumers will be left paying higher prices. They worry that the bill would prematurely make fossil fuel plants obsolete, rendering them stranded assets that don't generate revenue but still must be paid off by ratepayers.\n\"Not now,\" said Assemblyman Jim Patterson, a Republican from Fresno. \"This is a leap of faith and a gamble.\"\nThe action came as the Senate also considers legislation to turn California's energy grid manager, the Independent System Operator, into a regional entity open to utilities across the West, and as Gov. Jerry Brown and legislative leaders consider making it easier for utilities to reduce liability for wildfire damage. The issues could get linked in negotiations.","generate":"The California legislature has taken a significant step towards a sustainable future by reviving a bill aimed at achieving 100-percent carbon-free energy by 2045. This ambitious initiative reflects the state's commitment to combating climate change and transitioning to renewable energy sources. Advocates argue that this legislation is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fostering a healthier environment for future generations.\n\nThe bill, which had faced challenges in previous sessions, has garnered renewed support from environmental groups, lawmakers, and the public. Proponents emphasize the importance of investing in clean energy technologies, such as solar and wind power, to create jobs and stimulate the economy. As California continues to lead the way in environmental policy, the revival of this bill signals a hopeful shift towards a greener, more sustainable energy landscape. The discussions surrounding the bill will likely focus on ensuring equitable access to clean energy for all communities, particularly those historically impacted by pollution."}
{"text":"Finally, the die is cast.\nThe Vice President of the Ghana Football Association has been relieved of his duties following an Executive Committee meeting held on Tuesday.\nIt\u2019s interesting that the decision has come now, weeks after Afriyie announced at his 50th birthday party that he intended to contest in the 2019 GFA polls.\nIn the intervening period, the media waited for the blessing of Kwesi Nyantakyi for his vice. It never came. Instead, a loud silence filled the void, highlighting the rumoured rift between the two.\nThis rift, which had started months before when Afriyie had described Nyantakyi as greedy following disagreements over financial matters, has ultimately proven to have grown into Tuesday\u2019s announcement.\nLast year, Nyantakyi had also mentioned at one meeting, at least, that he wanted his deputy out because he suspected Afriyie of conniving with Nii Lante Vanderpuije, an avowed critic of the GFA boss.\nBut what will be the domino effect of Afriyie\u2019s sacking?\nBattle lines drawn\nBefore now, the line in the sand between the two men had been blurred. Now it\u2019s not, and both know where there are on the political divide. Without a doubt, Afriyie will now be emboldened to go all out in his quest to wrestle power from the GFA boss.\nEven though Afriyie has denied on several occasions that he was at loggerheads with Nyantakyi, the former\u2019s sacking has simply validated that rumour. This will pave way for the 50 year-old George, whose campaign team had already told Joy Sports that his plans for the future of Ghana football are ready.\nBut history is not on his side.\nFred Pappoe (sidelined in 2011), and Fred Crentsil (sidelined in 2015) are the two previous Vice Presidents who suddenly found themselves out of the position, and their subsequent career trajectories say a lot about Nyantakyi: he does not allow his former lieutenants to continue being influential in football circles.\nBut George has never been deterred by this, as he told Joy Sports following his announcement to contest.\n\u201cI think after serving on the Executive Committee for three terms and the role I have played in this current tenure, I have gained the experience needed as well as gone through the mill to and learnt enough to place me in a position to take over from my boss.\u201d\n\u201cIrrespective of the numerous criticisms, I believe this administration under Nyantakyi has achieved a lot and I don\u2019t think anyone is better placed to continue and build on the achievement than my good self,\u201d he said at the time.\nClearly, he was not singing from the same hymn sheet as his boss.\nRelationship at the Executive Committee level\nThe Executive Committee (ExCo) is the second most powerful decision making body of the Football Association, after the Emergency Committee.\nAnd since Nyantakyi announced he will not seek re-election several times within the last year, some names have popped up as possible contenders. None of those names were as high-profile as Afriyie.\nThis resulted in quiet division amongst the Exco \u2013 with some pandering towards him, while others felt Nyantakyi was still the right man for the job.\nThis toxic atmosphere at the helm of power needed to be fumigated. Trust Nyantakyi to deal with it, and he started doing so two weeks ago, when the FA announced that Afriyie had been removed as head of the Black Stars Management Committee. This position was one Afriyie had held since 2014, as a reward for his loyalty to Nyantakyi.\nHis removal was a clear signal that his end was near, and he knew. Last month, Afriyie told Kumasi-based Oyerepa FM that he was ready \u201cto leave this position\u2026because it is not for my mother or my father\u2019s lineage. Position is not possession.\u201d\nIf anyone was in doubt about the internal disquiet, some of Afriyie\u2019s own colleagues on the Exco publicly shamed him. These included Western Regional Football Association chairman Kojo Yankah, and Winfred Osei, who has now (conveniently) taken Afriyie\u2019s place at head of the Black Stars Management Committee.\n\u201cThere is nobody in the country that has more experience in football administration in Ghana than Kwesi Nyantakyi. He is the CAF Vice President and FIFA Council member,\u201d Osei said, effectively throwing Afriyie under the bus.\nIt is now clear that the relationships within the Executive Committee are frayed.\nNyantakyi will seek re-election in 2019?\nThe big picture of all this politicking has been because nobody is sure if Nyantakyi will go for his fourth term.\nThe experienced administrator has been at the helm since late 2005. Despite three straight qualifications to the World Cup, football in Ghana has not been at all rosy. Of particular has been the alarming decline in the Ghana Premier League by all stakeholders, and the death of the FA Cup for many years \u2013 until its revival some seven years ago.\nThough Nyantakyi himself maintains the league is one of the best organised on the continent, the calls for change have always come from the general public, and not the so-called \u2018football people\u2019.\nHowever, the sacking of his vice has finally emboldened opinions that to save his legacy, Nyantakyi will have to seek re-election. For the first time since 2005, the existence of enemies rallying for his downfall is a clear and present danger.\nBut Nyantakyi did not get this far by chance. He knows the game. He\u2019s played it since his mid-twenties, and he will not be easy to uproot.\nAs George Afriyie himself said about why he wanted the top job after denying it for years, \u201conly a fool doesn\u2019t change his mind\u201d.\nWe wait and see.","generate":"...this decision comes at a time when the association is striving to regain the trust of fans and stakeholders after a series of controversies. The Vice President, who had been in office for several years, faced mounting pressure due to allegations of mismanagement and a lack of transparency in financial dealings. \n\nIn a statement released after the meeting, the Executive Committee emphasized their commitment to fostering a culture of accountability and integrity within the organization. They expressed hope that this change would pave the way for new leadership that prioritizes the development of football in Ghana, particularly at the grassroots level.\n\nFans and players alike have voiced their concerns over the state of the sport, and many are optimistic that this decision marks a turning point. As the association looks to rebuild, the focus will be on creating a more inclusive environment that encourages collaboration and innovation, ultimately aiming to elevate Ghanaian football on the international stage."}

In order to avoid such problem in future the federal government should build a well-facilitated Sports Complex at Abbottabad where the weather remains moderate in summer and so national camps in that case could be easily held there in future,\u201d Yaqoob told \u2018The News\u2019 on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe have only one mega sports facility in the country in the shape of Pakistan Sports Complex at Islamabad. If at Abbottabad such a facility is managed then the camps could be held there from May to September, a time-frame in which weather in Islamabad is normally hot,\u201d said Yaqoob, also a former top police official.\nHe said that billions of rupees were wasted on building a sports complex in Narowal which could not be properly utilized as it was very far away.\u201cThere was no need to spend such a huge amount on Narowal Sports Complex which is not within the reach of sports fraternity. It would have been much better had land in Abbottabad been purchased and a sports complex built there which could be utilised for national cause,\u201d Yaqoob said.\nAround Rs1200 million has been spent on the construction of Narowal Sports Complex which is a multi-sport facility.He said Liaquat Gymnasium, housed in Pakistan Sports Complex Islamabad, is also not air-conditioned which creates a great problem for the volleyballers. \u201cLiaquat Gymnasium is not air-conditioned. When players practice there in hot weather they lose energy and become weak. If you have facility at Abbottabad then you can easily hold camps there in summer,\u201d the official said.\n\u201cMostly international events are held at a time when Pakistan is in grip of hot weather and constructing a complex at Abbottabad will be a long-term solution to the problem,\u201d Yaqoob reiterated.\nHe said if Islamabad-like sports facilities were managed at Abbottabad then in summer Pakistan would also be able to hold international events there.He also suggested that the state should enhance boarding facility at the Pakistan Sports Complex Islamabad. \u201cIf another hotsel is added to the existing ones then it will help meet the future pressure,\u201d Yaqoob said.\nAbout Pakistan\u2019s volleyball team camp for the Asian Games Yaqoob said they had requested the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) for an early camp.\u201cWe have requested the Board that our camp should be held early. You know hardly two and a half months time is left which is not sufficient. At least a four-month camp for the Asian Games was needed,\u201d the official pointed out. \u201cOther nations hold camps for such a mega event for years,\u201d he was quick to add.\nThe Asian Games are pencilled in for August 18 to September 2 in the Indonesian cities of Jakarta and Palembang. He said Pakistan\u2019s youth and junior team camps had also been shifted from Islamabad to Peshawar.\nAsian Games camps have not yet been initiated. The PSB will meet federations and Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) on June 6 in Islamabad to finalise some matters regarding the Asiad\u2019s preparations. A few days ago the PSB had to halt the already established camps for the Asian Games due to financial issues.\nYaqoob also informed that Pakistan\u2019s Iranian coach Hamid Movahedi would reach Pakistan on Thursday (today) to join camp in Peshawar. He said that he would handle all the three camps for junior, youth and senior with the assistance of his support staff.","generate":"that would cater to the needs of athletes across various sports. He emphasized that such a facility would not only enhance the training environment for volleyball players but also promote other sports in the region. \"Abbottabad has immense potential, and with the right infrastructure, we can nurture talent that can compete on international platforms,\" Yaqoob stated.\n\nHe highlighted the importance of investing in sports as a means to engage youth positively, providing them with opportunities to excel and stay away from negative influences. The proposed complex would include modern training facilities, accommodation for athletes, and spaces for community engagement, fostering a culture of health and fitness.\n\nYaqoob urged local authorities and stakeholders to collaborate in making this vision a reality, believing that a dedicated sports complex could serve as a hub for regional competitions and events, ultimately putting Abbottabad on the map as a center for sports excellence in Pakistan."}

{"text":"New Delhi: India's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation has not only \"significantly increased the political profile and potential\" of the grouping, but also the groups capacity to help stabilise the situation in Central and South Asia, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday.\nSpeaking at an event organised by the Vivekananda International Foundation on new vistas of India-Russia relations, the Russian Minister said that India's joining the SCO will also help \"resolve the crisis in and around Afghanistan\".\nEarlier, Lavrov said India's \"independent and responsible\" foreign policy has been \"an important factor contributing to global and regional security and stability\" and hoped that this \"legacy would be maintained and strengthened\".\nHe said that the current volume of trade between the two countries was not \"satisfactory\", and said that the aim is to increase this volume to $30 billion by 2025. He said that as the defence cooperation between the two countries deepens, it will lead to greater transfer of technology and technical know-how from Russia to India.\nLavrov also said the new US strategy of using force in Afghanistan against groups that refuse to cooperate is not likely to work.\n\"I don't think the recent US strategy on Afghanistan which puts emphasis on use of force to defeat those who refuse to cooperate and engage in violence, frankly, I don't think it would work,\" Lavrov said in response to a media query. \"Like in the last 16 years, the presence of huge army of NATO did not manage either to curb extremism and terrorism or to stop drug trade which has peaked this year. The production of heroin in Afghanistan may have been quadrupled since 9\/11,\" he said.\n\"It is to be understood and accepted that that this is something which feeds terrorist activities directly. And without precursors this drug production would not be possible. Most precursors come from Europe...We should not have double standards towards terrorism,\" the Minister added.\nLavrov also denied any support given by Russia to the Taliban as was being alleged by the US, and added that Russia's contact with Taliban was only to \"pressurise them to sit down and talk\".\n\"Never ever has there been any proof, any fact that Russia supported the Taliban as suggested by the US. We contacted Taliban only for two reasons. One, when our or our allies' citizens came harm's way and we needed to extract them. And secondly, to pressurise the Taliban to sit down and negotiate. But we always say that they must join negotiations provided they respect the criteria established by the UN Security Council,\" Lavrov said.\nAdding that he lately heard US officials calling upon Taliban to join negotiations without any criteria being respected, Lavrov told the audience that they could \"draw your own conclusions\".\nLavrov regretted that the US declined the \"Moscow Process\" and instead decided to go ahead with the \"Six Plus One\" group. The Six Plus One group formed in early 2016 includes India, Pakistan, Iran, Russia, the US and China in addition to Afghanistan.\nHe said the situation in Afghanistan could not be resolved without having \"everybody\" on board, including \"the government, the Taliban and those who can really influence the situation, including the neighbours\". He said the Kabul Process initiated by the government of Afghanistan in June this year was \"too large\" and that a smaller group of countries would be needed to resolve the political situation including all Central Asian countries.","generate":"...the region, experts say. With India as a member, the SCO has gained a more diverse perspective on security and economic cooperation, which is crucial in addressing the multifaceted challenges faced by member states. The inclusion of India, the world's largest democracy, brings a unique approach to counter-terrorism, trade, and cultural exchange, fostering a spirit of collaboration among nations.\n\nAnalysts believe that India's active participation can enhance regional connectivity initiatives, promoting trade routes that benefit all member countries. Furthermore, India's commitment to sustainable development aligns with the SCO's goals, paving the way for joint efforts in tackling climate change and resource management.\n\nAs the organization navigates complex geopolitical dynamics, India's role could be pivotal in bridging gaps between member states, fostering dialogue, and building trust.

We found improvements had been made with regard to safeguarding, staff understanding of the Mental Capacity Act and incident reporting procedures. But the trust still did not meet national ambulance response standards and over the winter period delays resulted in a number of serious incidents.\n\u201cWe were also concerned that, at the time of our inspection, staff morale was low.

Engaging with our staff, across a virtual organisation which is spread out across a an area of 7,500 square miles, can be a huge task.\n\u201cOur workforce are highly mobile and travel approx 12 million miles a year supporting or delivering the best care we can to patients.\n\u201cWe are working to ensure the leaders at every level in our organisation are given the time and space to build effective, communicative teams at a local level \u2013 particularly during tough periods like winter.\n\u201cWe are a united Board-level team with a wide range of expertise and experience to help us strengthen our service and help EEAST remain focused on our patients.\n\u201cThe care we provide for them means we\u2019re in the best position ever to provide the modern, high-quality and sustainable health services our communities need.\n\u201cWith the right investment, including \u00a311.5m of additional funding this year - we will get better and better.\u201d","generate":"...Commission (CQC). The CQC's assessment highlighted several areas where the service fell short, particularly in response times and patient care. Many staff members expressed their dedication to providing high-quality care, but they also noted the challenges posed by staffing shortages and increased demand.\n\nIn response to the report, the Chief Inspector emphasized the importance of addressing these issues promptly to ensure that patients receive the timely and compassionate care they deserve. The Trust has been urged to implement a robust action plan that focuses on improving training, enhancing communication among teams, and ensuring that resources are allocated effectively.\n\nLocal community members have voiced their concerns, sharing personal stories of how delays in ambulance response times have impacted their loved ones.

{"text":"Home is usually where the heart is, unless you are the New York Rangers.\nSunday night\u2019s 3-1 Game 3 loss to the Montreal Canadiens was the Blueshirts\u2019 sixth-consecutive home playoff loss at Madison Square Garden dating back to the 2014-15 postseason.\nTheir last victory came in Game 1 of the 2015 Eastern Conference Finals against the Tampa Bay Lightning, which was a series they lost in seven games.\nOver those six losses \u2014 which included three to Tampa Bay, two to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round last year and Sunday night against Montreal \u2014 the Rangers offense has been nonexistent having been outscored 21-4.\nGoaltender Henrik Lundqvist, who has carried the Rangers at times throughout his postseason career, has not been his usual stellar self during that stretch either with a .873 save percentage.\n\u201cWe have to give more at home in the playoffs or we aren\u2019t going to win,\u201d Lundqvist said after Game 3. \u201cWe need more. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\nNo one was exempt from his criticism either.\n\u201cEvery little detail matters,\u201d Lundqvist said. \u201cEvery play \u2026 We\u2019re going to need our best.\u201d\nIt has left head coach Alain Vigneault and his team facing a 2-1 series deficit ahead of Tuesday night\u2019s Game 4 at Madison Square Garden and frustration has slowly crept into the New York locker room.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that this group of players wants to do well in front of their fans,\u201d Vigneault said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re fighting it without a doubt. That should be evident.\u201d\nRight-winger Rick Nash certainly felt it.\n\u201cYeah [I feel frustrated],\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, any time you\u2019re not having success and you\u2019re getting chances and opportunities, there\u2019s definitely some frustration.\u201d\nCenter Derek Stepan acknowledged that struggle as well.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let it happen,\u201d he said. \u201cJust can\u2019t have any panic in your game.\u201d\nIt was clear that there was something off about the Rangers\u2019 play during Game 3. Despite having the home crowd behind them, New York looked hesitant to attack the Montreal goal and passed up a number of shot opportunities.\nThe lack of aggression saw the Rangers record just six shots apiece in the first and second periods. They tallied just 21 shots all game, making Canadiens goalie Carey Price\u2019s job far easier than Lundqvist\u2019s.\nThrough the opening three games of the series, Lundqvist has already faced 29 more shots than Price, which is an entire game\u2019s worth.\nThere have been plenty of chances for the Rangers to bombard the Montreal net too, especially on the man advantage. However, that tentative play has left the Rangers snakebitten and 0-for-10 on the power play so far this series.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get a lot of shots. A lot of one and dones,\u201d defenseman and captain Ryan McDonagh said. \u201cWe\u2019re not making passes in the offensive zone, just making hope plays.\u201d\nVigneault honed in on his best players and laid some of the blame on them.\n\u201cAt this time, right now, our fourth line is our best line,\u201d Vigneault said. \u201cSo our top players need to find their game and they obviously don\u2019t have it right now.\u201d\nThe Rangers did indeed feed off the energy exhibited by the fourth line. Center Oscar Lindberg had New York\u2019s best chance in the first period on Sunday when his wrister hit the post while Tanner Glass and Jesper Fast provided a high-intensity style of play during their limited time on the ice.\nNew York\u2019s first line of Chris Kreider, Stepan and Mats Zuccarello have accounted for just one goal through the first three games of the series. Third-line winger Michael Grabner already has two.\nAt the end of the day though, it\u2019s only a one-game deficit for now. A strong showing on Tuesday night can rectify any reservations surrounding the team and allow them to seize momentum for their trip back to Montreal for Game 5.\n\u201cThis is the playoffs,\u201d Nash said. \u201cYou have to figure out what you\u2019re doing wrong and get over it.\u201d","generate":"...defeat, a streak that has left fans and players alike scratching their heads. The once-impregnable fortress of Madison Square Garden has turned into a house of horrors for the Rangers, who have struggled to find their rhythm on home ice. \n\nDespite a spirited effort, the team fell short against a determined Canadiens squad that capitalized on their chances. The Rangers' frustration was palpable as they skated off the ice, with players acknowledging the weight of the moment. \u201cWe need to find a way to turn this around,\u201d said captain Jacob Trouba, his voice heavy with disappointment. \n\nThe fans, who filled the arena with hope and chants, were left to ponder what went wrong. The Rangers must now regroup and find a way to channel the energy of their loyal supporters into a winning performance. With the series hanging in the balance, the team knows that the road ahead will be challenging, but they remain committed to fighting for every inch."}

Sixty-seven people were wounded in the blast.\nU.S.-backed Iraqi forces are currently fighting to push Islamic State from the northern city of Mosul, but are facing fierce resistance. The group has lost most of the territory it seized in a blitz across northern and western Iraq in 2014.\nThe recapture of Mosul would probably spell the end for its self-styled caliphate, but the militants would still be capable of fighting a guerrilla-style insurgency in Iraq, and plotting or inspiring attacks on the West.\nThree bombs killed 29 people across the capital on Saturday, and an attack near the southern city of Najaf on Sunday left seven policemen dead.

Their charred bodies were visible inside the burnt-out remains of the vehicle. Blood stained the ground nearby.\nA separate blast near a hospital in central Baghdad killed one civilian and wounded nine, police and medical sources said.\n\u201cThe terrorists will attempt to attack civilians in order to make up for their losses, but we assure the Iraqi people and the world that we are able to end terrorism and shorten its life,\u201d Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told reporters after meeting with visiting French President Francois Hollande.\nHollande, whose country has faced a series of militant attacks in the past two years, said French soldiers serving in a U.S.-led coalition against the jihadists in Iraq were preventing more mass killings at home.\nAhmed Saad \/ Reuters People gather at the site of car bomb attack in a busy square at Baghdad's sprawling Sadr City district, in Iraq January 2, 2017.\nROAD TO MOSUL\nSince the drive to recapture Mosul began on Oct. 17, elite forces have retaken a quarter of the city in the biggest ground operation in Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Abadi has said the group will be driven out of the country by April.\nClashes continued in and around Mosul on Monday. The counter-terrorism service (CTS) blew up several Islamic State car bombs before they reached their targets, and linked up with the Rapid Response forces, an elite Interior Ministry unit, said spokesman Sabah al-Numani.\nCTS was also clearing North Karma district of remaining militants, the fourth area the unit has retaken in the past week, he said.\nIslamic State targeted military positions away from the main battlefield, killing at least 16 pro-government fighters and cutting a strategic road linking the city to Baghdad.\nMilitants attacked an army barracks near Baiji, 180 km (110 miles) north of the capital, killing four soldiers and wounding 12 people, including Sunni tribal fighters, army and police sources said.\nThey seized weapons there and launched mortars at nearby Shirqat, forcing security forces to impose a curfew and close schools and offices in the town, according to local officials and security sources.\nShirqat mayor Ali Dodah said Islamic State seized three checkpoints on the main road linking Baiji to Shirqat following the attacks. Shelling in Shirqat had killed at least two children, he told Reuters by phone.\nIn a separate incident, gunmen broke into a village near Udhaim, 90 km (56 miles) north of Baghdad, where they executed nine Sunni tribal fighters with shots to the head, police and medical sources said.","generate":"...2023.

{"text":"Jerome \"Jay\" Powell, the Republican former investment banker tapped by President Donald Trump to lead the US Federal Reserve, will take the reins of monetary policy starting Monday.Perhaps the wealthiest Fed chair ever, Powell -- who turns 65 on Sunday -- succeeds Janet Yellen, who ends the first and only term held by a woman.He takes over at a remarkably quiet time following a decade of economic turmoil that forced the central bank into uncharted policy waters to try to recover from the global financial crisis.Nevertheless, Powell, one of the rare non-economists to fill the role, could soon face difficult policy decisions that will put him at the center of debate over how fast to raise interest rates.Wages in January posted the biggest annual increase in nearly 10 years, with the growing US economy adding jobs at a solid pace, and while business and consumer confidence remains high just as a massive corporate tax reform is starting to take effect.This comes at a time when all major global economies are growing simultaneously, an unusual and happy coincidence, but one that begins to raise concerns about when the recovery will end. And how.\"His biggest challenge will be leading the further calibration of interest rates when the US economy is late cycle amid a synchronized global economic upswing and fiscal stimulus is on its way,\" Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics told AFP.As Yellen departs, the only Fed chair in nearly 40 years not to be reappointed for a second term, she leaves an economy with unemployment at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent -- half the rate when she became chair -- quiet inflation and nearly four years of uninterrupted growth.In addition, she steered the Fed out of its massive bond buying program and began the process of \"normalization,\" or reducing the size of investment holdings, without upsetting the skittish financial markets.Yellen prevailed in the debate to raise interest rates only gradually to ensure the economic recovery was on solid footing. The Fed has raised the key lending rate five times in her tenure, including three times last year.\"Yellen hands the incoming Chair Jerome Powell a more 'normalized' economic and monetary policy environment,\" Bostjancic said.The Fed in December raised the benchmark lending rate for the third time last year, and indicated that another three hikes were likely this year.But the minutes of the meeting show there was heated debate among the policymakers about how quickly they would need to move this year based on differing outlooks for inflation and the impact of the tax cuts.Inflation has remained stubbornly below the Fed's two percent target, but the policy statement last week said the central bank expects prices to move up in the near term.The first rate increase of 2018 is widely expected to come in March, which also will feature the first press conference by Powell, who has served on the Fed board since 2012.\"Massive fiscal policy piled on top of an economy that was growing solidly and has limited labor availability has not been tried before,\" economist Joel Naroff said.\"How this 'Grand Fiscal Experiment' affects wage and price inflation is something Fed has to be worried about.\"In practical terms, raising rates more quickly has challenges.The Fed can decide to move at any time, whether it has a policy meeting scheduled or not, but officials like to telegraph their intentions to markets clearly to avoid any upset, and explain the decision once it has been made.So since 2011, the committee has only announced rate changes at one of the quarterly meetings that include press conferences by the Fed chair. That means a faster pace of rate hikes would mean four rather than three this year. More increases than that could really spook markets into thinking the Fed is seeing real cause for concern about the threat of inflation or the durability of the recovery.","generate":"...individual to hold this position, Powell's background in finance has raised both hopes and concerns among various economic circles. As he steps into this pivotal role, many are eager to see how his leadership will shape the future of the U.S. economy, particularly in light of ongoing challenges such as inflation and unemployment.\n\nPowell's approach is expected to balance the need for growth with the responsibility of maintaining stability in the financial system. His commitment to transparency and communication will be crucial as he navigates the complexities of monetary policy. Observers are particularly interested in how he will address the needs of everyday Americans, ensuring that economic recovery is inclusive and benefits all sectors of society.\n\nAs he embarks on this journey, Powell faces the daunting task of fostering confidence in the economy while responding to the diverse needs of the nation. His decisions will undoubtedly impact millions, making his leadership a focal point for both policymakers and the public alike."}
{"text":"Google's Project Fi, a phone service that in the U.S. piggybacks off the major carriers and Wi-Fi, has added three new phones that will work with the service, additions that could interest more customers.\nBut without Apple's iPhone as an option, the foray is still likely to remain somewhat of a curiosity.\nOn Wednesday, Google announced that three new handsets will be coming soon to Fi, starting with the budget-oriented $199 moto G6 that is now available for preorder. Motorola\u2019s phone normally goes for $50 or more.\nThe other devices, both from LG, are higher-end smartphones: the $740 LG G7 ThinQ and the $899 LG V35 ThinQ.\nProject Fi quietly has been plugging along since April 2015 when Google launched its then-invitation-only phone service. Very few phones are compatible with the service, which has remained low-key.\nThese latest phones, each with large screens, portrait mode-equipped cameras and expandable storage, join the only others in what remains a thin Project Fi portfolio: Google\u2019s own Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL; the Android One moto x4; plus the older Google devices that are still supported, the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Pixel and Pixel XL.\nExpanding the Fi lineup certainly is a positive, but it\u2019s still difficult to imagine that Fi will suddenly gain a bevy of new customers, especially since it still lacks the most prized phones on the market from Apple and Samsung.\n\u201cThe handset choice \u2014 or better, the lack of it \u2014 is a big hurdle,\u201d says Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics. \u201cNot having iPhones is literally halving its addressable market.\u201d\nFi never emerged as the disruptive force in wireless that some predicted when rumors first surfaced that Google had designs on becoming an Internet Service Provider. For its part, Google maintained that it wasn\u2019t trying to overtake the cellular business but rather to showcase what was possible when the company could manage the hardware in its devices, the software in Android and the connectivity with Fi.\nThe appeal of the service for consumers is that Google charges low rates \u2014 $20 a month for unlimited calls and texts, plus $10 for each gigabyte of data up to 6GB. But Google doesn\u2019t charge you for data you don\u2019t use.\nOf course, the environment has changed since 2015, with consumers now having many attractive unlimited wireless plans from which to choose.\nGoogle\u2019s network is actually an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) that in the U.S. uses T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular and automatically chooses the fastest and strongest available network to glom onto, whether that\u2019s cellular or Wi-Fi.(Overseas, it works with a European provider Three.)\nGoogle didn\u2019t answer a question on how a T-Mobile\/Sprint merger, if approved, might impact Fi.\nNor has Google said how many customers use Fi, though the company claims a \"healthy user base\" and \"high customer satisfaction.\"\n\u201cI don't think it is growing much if any at all,\u201d Entner says. \u201cAdvertising and promotion is the lifeblood of any wireless brand. Without it, and I haven't seen any advertising for it, it languishes.

Project Fi's commitment to transparency in pricing and data usage remains a key selling point, appealing to those who value straightforward billing without hidden fees. \n\nAs the demand for reliable mobile services continues to grow, Google\u2019s initiative to broaden its device compatibility reflects its dedication to meeting the diverse needs of consumers. This move not only strengthens Project Fi's position in the competitive market but also reinforces the importance of user choice in today\u2019s technology landscape."}

{"text":"Our short showers and drizzle aren\u2019t going away. But the dayslong drenchings that sometimes soak the city? They\u2019ve been happening more, according to a Seattle Public Utilities study.\nAttention, Seattle residents: Have you noticed more steady, long-lasting rainstorms in a city better known for gray skies, short showers and drizzle? Turns out you\u2019re on to something.\nOver the last 15 years, the city\u2019s had more extreme rain, according to a new study by Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) officials, who say the weather is a climate-change preview.\n\u201cThis confirms our anecdotal evidence,\u201d said James Rufo-Hill, an SPU meteorologist. \u201cFor years, people have been saying, \u2018I think the rain is getting worse around here,\u2019 and now the data shows that.\u201d\nSPU has been measuring rainfall for about four decades with gauges in 17 locations across the city, such as Magnuson Park, the Maple Leaf Reservoir, Fauntleroy Ferry Dock and Aki Kurose Middle School.\nThe information from the gauges helps SPU plan and design drainage and sewage projects, Rufo-Hill said.\nThe last major rainfall study was in 2003, so SPU had some catching up to do. The sprinklings most common in Seattle aren\u2019t going away, according to Rufo-Hill. And the city\u2019s rare flash storms aren\u2019t necessarily worsening.\nSeattle has a longer-than-average rainy season, but is only 44th nationally in total accumulation, less than such cities as Atlanta, Houston and New York.\nThat\u2019s partly because our typical rain comes from low, layered clouds rather than high, dense clouds. And that may be a reason why many of us are umbrella-averse.\n\u201cMost of the rain we get hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Rufo-Hill said.\nBut according to the SPU study released in December, \u201cextreme\u201d rainstorms have become more common \u2014 and more extreme.\nWhat exactly does that mean? SPU measures storms by how long they last and how much rain they dump, and then categorizes those storms based on how often they can be expected to occur.\nWhat used to be considered a once-in-a-century storm for a 24-hour period \u2014 4 inches \u2014 can now be expected once every 25 years, according to Rufo-Hill. The new standard for a once-in-a-century storm for a 24-hour period is more than 5 inches.\nAnother example based on the addition of 15 years of data: What used to be a once-in-a-century storm for a 6-hour period \u2014 1.86 inches \u2014 can now be expected every 25 years, according to SPU\u2019s modeling.\nAlso becoming more extreme are rainstorms lasting six hours and those lasting three days with levels of precipitation expected every five or 10 years. Another, more poetic name for these superstorms: \u201catmospheric rivers.\u201d\n\u201cOur definitions of extreme and normal have changed,\u201d Rufo-Hill said.\nHere\u2019s something confusing: Seattle has been hit with at least 4 inches of rain in 24 hours several times since SPU started keeping track \u2014 in 1981, 1986, 2003, 2007 and 2010. That\u2019s a lot more than once every 25 years.\nWhat gives? SPU\u2019s projections take the superlong view rather than concentrating only on what\u2019s happened since its gauges were installed in 1977, Rufo-Hill said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing the best we can with the sample size we have,\u201d he said.\nWanting it to stop\nThe science is complicated, but some long-timers say it sure seems like the change has been easy to see.\n\u201cI used to be able to pedal my bike and stay dry with the evaporation,\u201d said John Dunlap, who moved to Seattle about 40 years ago.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that now,\u201d said Dunlap, who was shopping at REI for cross-country skiing gear and hoping for some extreme snow in the mountains. \u201cThe drops are bigger.\u201d\nTerrie Botts, a retired engineer, isn\u2019t the type of person to trust her instincts. She likes evidence. But the lifelong area resident also has wondered whether the skies are dumping more rain on her town. Not that she minds.\n\u201cI\u2019m in harmony with the rain,\u201d Botts said. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who gets bummed out.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s Jose Mayorquin, a web developer. He thinks the SPU data make sense, having noticed more storms that \u201clast all day long and I just want it to stop.\u201d\nBut Mayorquin, who grew up in Seattle, sees a silver lining amid the city\u2019s recent population explosion.\n\u201cHopefully it\u2019ll stop people from moving here,\u201d he quipped.\nNot likely, with a record number of apartment buildings under construction. Down the block in booming South Lake Union, Jesse Peck was working on one of them, grateful for a break in the rain.\nDownpours make construction work harder and wetter, said the electrician, who lives in Sultan.\n\u201cWe have guys working eight hours a day just dealing with the water that gets in\u201d before a building is fitted with windows and roof, he said. \u201cSeems like there are more days where it never stops raining.\u201d\nDavid Laskin wrote the book on that. Literally. The self-described \u201cweather nut\u201d penned \u201cRains All the Time: A Connoisseur\u2019s History of Weather in the Pacific Northwest.\u201d\n\u201cThe one thing I love most about rain in Seattle is the variability. My personal favorite is the convergence-zone rain, where you can see the air masses come together with pouring rain,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most weather nuts tend to love extremes.\u201d\nThe new measurements matter \u2014 and not only because they interest amateur weather watchers like Laskin, Rufo-Hill said.\nBuilt for a drip\nSPU will use the information to help make decisions about projects that prevent flooding and protect the environment.\nIn parts of the city with pipes that receive both sewage from buildings and stormwater from streets, rainstorms can overwhelm the system and send a nasty mixture spewing into local waterways.\nTo comply with a 2013 consent decree, SPU is building an enormous storage tunnel under the Lake Washington Ship Canal. The tunnel will keep nearly 60 million gallons of polluted water out of the canal each year.\nThat effort is already on its way, but future projects will benefit from the new rainfall data, Rufo-Hill said.\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re putting a pipe in the ground, we\u2019ll use this data in combination with other information to determine exactly how much larger it should be,\u201d the SPU scientist said.\n\u201cGenerally speaking, Seattle\u2019s drainage and wastewater infrastructure was sized for a different climate,\u201d he added. \u201cSeattle\u2019s system was built for a drip, not a downpour, and we\u2019re seeing more downpours.\u201d\nThe rainfall information also is important because scientists like Rufo-Hill think climate change will ensure that extreme rainstorms continue.\n\u201cWe may have just gone through a period of variability. But the best-available science suggests\u201d there will be change over the long term, he said.\nMayor Jenny Durkan mentioned the increase in extreme rainstorms this week while touting steps she contends the city must take to combat climate change, such as installing electric-vehicle charging stations and solar panels.\n\u201cCities don\u2019t have the luxury of climate denial and cannot wait for federal leaders to embrace science. The effect of inaction is already at our doorstep,\u201d Durkan said in a statement.\nSPU\u2019s study, Rufo-Hill said, jibes with local rainfall data collected by the National Weather Service.\nAnd Logan Johnson, meteorologist-in-charge at the service\u2019s Seattle weather-forecast office, brought up another reason to pay attention.\n\u201cThis study underscores the need to better prepare for flooding, not only in Seattle, but throughout Western Washington,\u201d Johnson said.","generate":"...residents are urged to prepare for the changing climate patterns that are becoming increasingly evident. The study highlights a troubling trend: while light rain may be a staple of our Pacific Northwest lifestyle, the intensity and frequency of heavy rainfall events are on the rise. This shift not only impacts our daily routines but also poses significant challenges for our infrastructure and natural ecosystems.\n\nAs we navigate these changes, it\u2019s essential for the community to come together. Simple actions like maintaining drainage systems, planting trees, and conserving water can make a difference. Local organizations are stepping up, offering resources and workshops to help residents adapt to these new realities. \n\nLet\u2019s embrace our role as stewards of this beautiful city, ensuring that we protect it for future generations.

{"text":"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will take action to defend its interests if the United States damages trade ties, the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump authorized an inquiry into China's alleged theft of intellectual property.\nTrump's move, the first direct trade measure by his administration against China, comes at a time of heightened tension over North Korea's nuclear ambitions, though it is unlikely to prompt near-term change in commercial ties.\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will have a year to look into whether to launch a formal investigation of China's policies on intellectual property, which the White House and U.S. industry groups say are harming U.S. businesses and jobs.\nThe United States should respect objective facts, act prudently, abide by its World Trade Organization pledges, and not destroy principles of multilateralism, an unidentified spokesman of China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.\n\"If the U.S. side ignores the facts, and disrespects multilateral trade principles in taking actions that harms both sides trade interests, China will absolutely not sit by and watch, will inevitably adopt all appropriate measures, and resolutely safeguard China's lawful rights.\"\nThe ministry said the United States should \"treasure\" the cooperation and favorable state of China-U.S. trade relations, and warned that any U.S. action to damage ties would \"harm both sides trade relations and companies\".\nChina was continuously strengthening its administrative and judicial protections for intellectual property, the ministry added.\nChina's policy of forcing foreign companies to turn over technology to Chinese joint venture partners and failure to crack down on intellectual property theft have been longstanding problems for several U.S. administrations.\nTrump administration officials have estimated that theft of intellectual property by China could be worth as much as $600 billion.\nExperts on China trade policy said the long lead time could allow Beijing to discuss some of the issues raised by Washington without being seen to cave to pressure under the threat of reprisals.\nChina repeatedly rebuffed attempts by previous U.S. administrations to take action on its IP practices, and has insisted it rigorously protects intellectual property.\nState news agency Xinhua said the U.S. investigation is a unilateralist \"baring of fangs\" that will hurt both sides.\nJacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council said Trump's memo is only the beginning of the process, but that he expected a decision on how to move forward from the administration in 60-90 days.\n\"I think it will be much faster than a year,\" Parker said.\nComing to terms on a bilateral investment treaty would be a better way to get China to address the IP issues, he added.\n\"This isn't a surprise. Our companies have been honing their crisis communications and internal planning processes since the election. The rhetoric that came up during the campaign led them to take proactive action then. They are prepared, aware and ready for these types of actions going forward.\"\nThe investigation is likely to cast a shadow over U.S. relations with China, its largest trading partner, just as Trump is asking it to put more pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear programm.\nTrump has suggested he would be more amenable to going easy on China over trade if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea.\nChina has said the issues of trade with the United States should not be linked to the North Korea problem.\nKen Jarrett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said in a statement on Tuesday that trade and North Korea should not be linked, but that the investigation was a \"measured and necessary step\".\n\"The president's executive order reflects building frustration with Chinese trade and market entry policies, particularly those that pressure American companies to part with technologies and intellectual property in exchange for market access,\" he said.\n\"Chinese companies operating in the United States do not face this pressure.\"","generate":"...announced plans to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods. The ministry expressed deep concern over the potential escalation of trade tensions, emphasizing that such measures could harm both economies and disrupt global markets. \"We urge the U.S. to reconsider its approach and engage in constructive dialogue,\" a spokesperson stated, highlighting the importance of cooperation in addressing mutual concerns.\n\nIn response to the tariffs, China is prepared to implement countermeasures that protect its economic interests and support its domestic industries. The ministry reiterated its commitment to fair trade practices and the principles of mutual respect and benefit. As the world's two largest economies navigate these turbulent waters, the hope remains that both sides can find common ground to foster a more stable and prosperous trading environment. The ongoing dialogue is crucial, as the repercussions of a trade war could extend far beyond their borders, affecting millions of lives globally."}

In a meeting convened late in the evening, they decided to continue the strike till their longstanding demand is met. \u201cWe have succumbed to the government\u2019s hollow promises in the past and have learnt our lesson all too well. We cannot be deceived yet again,\u201d Dr. Asfandyar maintained.\nMeanwhile, JI leader Mian Muhammad Aslam and CDA representative Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin also expressed solidarity with the protesters by joining them at PIMS. \u201cUnity in your ranks will leave the government with no other option but to pass the amendment bill. You have the power to get it done. We will not surrender PIMS to any force,\u201d the JI leader stated.","generate":"...position amid ongoing protests by the staff of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS).

But sadly many people aren\u2019t getting one.\nNew research* reveals that the average Brit wakes up three times during the night, and for one in 10 of us it\u2019s 7 to 10 times.\nHere\u2019s 10 reasons people say they can\u2019t get a good night\u2019s sleep.\n1. Going to the toilet\nNearly half those surveyed (47%) have to get up to use the loo during the night. This happens more often if we\u2019ve had liquids before going to bed, and functions as nature\u2019s own little alarm clock. Unfortunately, it usually goes off around 3am\u2026\n2. Being woken up by discomfort\nA bad back or even general aches and pains are keeping 19% of us awake at night.\n3. Snoring\nA hefty 41% of us fed up of having to poke our other halves until they turn over.\n4. Being edged out\nA sizeable 25% of us wake up to find ourselves occupying a sliver of space on the edge of the bed, as our partners have managed to occupy our side as well as theirs.\n5. Tossing and turning\nThis affects 10.5% of us too, whether it\u2019s us doing it, or our partners.\n6. Bedroom talk\n10% of us have to put up with our partner talking, or making other weird noises, in their sleep\n7. Phone problems\n10% of us are woken up by our partner looking at their phone, because no matter what manufacturers say, the light that emits from them at night is still enough to wake people up.\n8. Brought to book 4.6% of us are woken by a partner who is watching TV or reading (presumably because they can\u2019t get to sleep).\n9. Bad dreams or nightmares\nThese affect 11% of us - and who hasn\u2019t woken up sweating about the bogeyman under the bed?\n10. Plain old anxiety\nThis affects 6% of us. We\u2019re worrying about the next day at work, bills, relationships, waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to get back to sleep...\nThe survey of 2,000 British adults was carried out by mattress company Tweak Mattress (tweakmattress.com).\nPsychologist Robert Stewart said: \u201cThere are two main reasons our sleep is good or poor, and these are our sleep hygiene and our sleep cycles.\n\u201cSleep hygiene relates to our \u2018before-bed\u2019 routine. Not drinking or eating a lot, choosing the same time to sleep each night, and not looking at phones, laptops or TV in bed, to name a few.\n\u201cGetting these right should help in getting you off to sleep, but more importantly, there are the sleep cycles you go through.\n\u201cA person will go through 5 stages of sleep in a night and each of these vary in depth.\n\u201cStage 5 or rapid eye movement (REM) stage is the lightest stage of sleep and this is where people are most likely to stir.\n\u201cWhilst we cannot control this, the surrounding environment, such as a partner snoring, other noise or discomfort, will impact on whether we return to sleep smoothly or are awoken.\n\u201cSo to drift back to sleep seamlessly and without disturbance, ensure you have the best environment to aid this, whether it be earplugs or a comfortable mattress.\u201d","generate":"...feeling more tired than refreshed, with nearly one in three adults reporting that they struggle to get a full night\u2019s sleep.

They also recommend limiting screen exposure at least an hour before bed to help the body wind down naturally. \n\nSleep is not just a luxury; it\u2019s essential for our physical and mental well-being.

{"text":"All the major technology companies have strict policies prohibiting harassment and other bullying behaviour on their services, but primarily rely on users to report abuses and weed them out.\nRepresentation pic\nMelania Trump is hosting executives from major online and social media companies to discuss cyberbullying and internet safety, more than a year after saying that would be her issue as first lady. The meeting today marks her first public event on the topic, a choice some observers have questioned given that her husband often berates people on Twitter. Amazon, Snap, Facebook, Google and Twitter are among the companies that are expected to attend the meeting. The Internet Association said it will also be represented.\nAll the major technology companies have strict policies prohibiting harassment and other bullying behaviour on their services, but primarily rely on users to report abuses and weed them out. They try to clearly spell out the kinds of remarks and other posts that won't be tolerated in special sections such as one Facebook, the largest online social network, has set up. Instagram, a popular service among kids and young adults for sharing photos and videos, provides links to the US government's anti-bullying site and tips from a cyberbullying research center on one of its help pages.\nBut the efforts so far have fallen short, leading to rampant abuses that even some of the companies acknowledge have driven away or tormented portions of their audience. It got so bad on Twitter, which has 68 million US users, that the San Francisco company vowed last fall to crack down on hateful tweets. Among other things, Twitter adopted new policies aimed at protecting women who unknowingly or unwillingly had nude pictures of themselves distributed online a common bullying tactic.\nYik Yak, another messaging app once popular among high school and college students, shut down last year partly because schools banned it following complaints about bullying and harassment. Online bullying takes many shapes, but some of the most common tactics include posting embarrassing or salacious photos, making demeaning or cruel remarks under a photo or in a general post about someone, and sharing screenshots of what at least one person thought was a private text.\nHarassment is widespread and extends beyond teenagers. A Pew Research Center poll last year found 41 percent of US adults believed they had been harassed online. The popularity of and volume of content on major social media sites presents a huge challenge in policing what is being shared. Facebook, for instance, has 2.1 billion worldwide users who collectively share billions of posts on their pages daily. More than 300 hours of video is uploaded to Google's YouTube site every minute.\nThe companies are also constantly struggling to balance the desire to prevent harassment and other abuses and maintain a commitment to freedom of expression. In some cases, they see harassment and still look the other way. For instance, some of President Trump's more vitriolic tweets have openly mocked and denigrated people, prompting calls for Twitter to shut down his account and ban him from its service. But Twitter has declined, maintaining the news value of the president's tweets eclipse complaints about him being a bully.\nThere is no federal law that applies to bullying. State laws vary, ranging from requiring public schools to have a bullying policy to requiring anonymous reporting systems, said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University. The federal government can best help by giving schools more tools and money to provide programs, Hinduja said. Trump announced in a speech near the end of the 2016 presidential campaign that her priority as first lady would be to fight cyberbullying. A native of Slovenia, she at the time lamented a US culture that she said had grown \"too mean and too rough.\" It was a curious speech for a woman whose husband uses Twitter to dismiss people as losers and taunt them with unflattering nicknames.\nThe mother of a 12-year-old son, the first lady has made child well-being her focus in the White House, including an unexpected interest in how the opioid crisis is affecting youngsters. She has visited hospitals and care centers to see the effects first hand, and has embraced parents whose children died from drug overdoses. She accompanied the president to New Hampshire on Monday as he discussed a three-pronged effort to combat drug addiction, including applying the death penalty against those caught trafficking highly addictive substances. Mrs. Trump recently asked the spouses of US governors to help promote values such as encouragement, kindness, compassion and respect in children. She has also spoken about limiting the amount of time children spend online, and helping them understand the content they are exposed to.\nCatch up on all the latest Crime, National, International and Hatke news here.

However, the effectiveness of these policies often hinges on the willingness of users to speak up. Many individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities, may hesitate to report incidents due to fear of retaliation or disbelief. This highlights the need for technology companies to not only enforce their policies but also to foster a culture of support and understanding.\n\nTo truly combat harassment, companies must invest in proactive measures, such as enhanced moderation tools and training for staff to recognize and address harmful behavior. Additionally, creating clear channels for reporting that prioritize user safety and anonymity can empower more individuals to come forward. \n\nUltimately, a collaborative effort between users and tech companies is essential.

For instance, you can wear a cute sun hat, floppy hat or beach hat with any casual dress you own.\nThe color of your skin should determine what color clothing you should wear. If you are very pale, avoid colors that will make you appear paler, like beiges, yellows and whites.

Oval faces look great with nearly any hairstyle, while round faces do better with hairstyles that have height. Pear faces look better with round cuts and triangular faces look better with short cuts. Square faces look great with all kinds of cuts, except those that are flat on top.\nOne great piece of fashion advice is to make sure that you check yourself from all angles before walking out your door. This is important because you do not want to be embarrassed due to either a strange fit, a stain, or leaving a tag on. Have someone else to check for you as well, if possible.\nFor a fun and simple daytime look, wear your hair in a casual up-do.

{"text":"Audi\u2019s e-tron prototype, the forerunner of its coming series-production battery-electric SUV, features a drag coefficient of 0.28\u2014a top result in the SUV segment. The figure is a decisive factor in the everyday range of more than 400 kilometers (248.5 mi) in the WLTP cycle; a hundredth of the drag coefficient figure represents a range of around five kilometers (3.1 mi) driving under everyday conditions, Audi says.\nOn the aeroacoustics test rig in the Wind Tunnel Center in Ingolstadt\u2014the world\u2019s quietest vehicle wind tunnel\u2014Audi engineers optimize drag and noise under extreme conditions. With an output of 2.6 MW, the fan produces speeds of up to 300 km\/h (186.4 mph). The Audi e-tron prototype was put through more than 1,000 hours of testing here.\nTo achieve the drag coefficient of 0.28, the Audi engineers developed a wide range of aerodynamics measures in all body areas. Some of these technical solutions are evident at first glance, while others fulfill their purpose hidden away from sight.\nWith these solutions, the drag coefficient for the Audi e-tron prototype is almost 0.07 less than for a comparable, conventionally powered vehicle. With a typical usage profile this set-up increases the range by around 35 kilometers (21.7 mi) per battery charge in the WLTP cycle.\nVirtual exterior mirrors and dimples on the underbody. The optional virtual exterior mirrors will be making their world premiere in the volume-production version of the Audi e-tron prototype. They are much narrower than the standard mirrors: They reduce the vehicle width by 15 centimeters (5.9 in) and, given their new shape, not only reduce drag, but also noticeably cut the nonetheless low wind noise.\nEach of their flat supports integrates a small camera. The captured images appear on OLED displays in the transition between the instrument panel and door. The virtual exterior mirrors can be adapted for various driving situations, thus potentially improving safety. Three views are available in the MMI system: for highway driving, turning and parking.\nAnother important factor is the standard adaptive air suspension\u2014a pneumatic suspension with adjustable damping. At speeds above 120 km\/h (74.6 mph), it lowers the body by up to 26 millimeters (1.0 in) below the normal position, thus reducing the drag. The underbody of the all-electric SUV is fully enclosed; the front and rear area are fully paneled.\nUnderneath the passenger cell, an aluminum plate protects the high-voltage battery against damage from below, such as stone chipping or curbs. Its bolting points come with bowl-shaped indentations, similar to the dimples on a golf ball. They make the air flow much better than a totally flat surface.\nThe controllable cool-air inlet \u2013 a frame behind the Singleframe with two electrically operated louvers\u2014also helps lower drag. When shut, the air in this area flows with virtually no swirl. As soon as the drivetrain components need cooling or the air conditioning condenser requires ventilation, the top louver opens first and then both louvers. When the hydraulic wheel brakes are subject to high loads, the controllable cool-air inlet opens and releases two ducts which channel the cooling air into the front wheel arches to the brakes.\nThe side air inlets at the front of the Audi e-tron prototype incorporate additional ducts, which are clearly visible from outside, to the wheel arches. They channel the airstream so that it flows past the outside of the standard aerodynamically optimized 19-inch wheels. Their design is flatter than with conventional wheels. The 255\/55 size tires stand out with their ultralow rolling resistance. Even the tire sidewalls add to the aerodynamic design\u2014the lettering is negative instead of raised.","generate":"...enhancing the vehicle's efficiency and range. A lower drag coefficient means that the e-tron can cut through the air more smoothly, reducing energy consumption and allowing for longer journeys on a single charge. This is particularly important for electric vehicles, where maximizing range is a key concern for consumers.\n\nIn addition to its aerodynamic design, the e-tron prototype incorporates advanced technologies that contribute to its performance. The vehicle is equipped with a sophisticated all-wheel-drive system that ensures optimal traction and stability, even in challenging driving conditions. Audi has also focused on creating a luxurious interior, blending high-quality materials with cutting-edge infotainment systems to provide a comfortable and connected driving experience.\n\nAs Audi prepares to launch the e-tron, the company aims to position itself as a leader in the electric SUV market, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers who do not want to compromise on style or performance."}

{"text":"fongbeerredhot\/ShutterstockIf you\u2019re a smoker and you\u2019re not yet thinking about quitting, you need to think again. If the fact that smoking ruins your looks isn\u2019t reason enough to quit, how about the fact that it could kill you? Smoking can exacerbate diabetes because it raises your blood sugar. Smoking is responsible for nearly half of all liver cancers. And quitting smoking decreases your risk of a cardiovascular disease by 50 percent after just one year. Hey, look, why don\u2019t we just agree that \u201csmoking is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and premature mortality worldwide,\u201d which was how an esteemed group of scholars from the United Kingdom introduced the findings of their recent study in the scientific journal Thorax, which demonstrated that undergoing lung cancer screening\u2014in the form of a CT scan\u2014may push smokers to finally kick the habit.\nThe study, led by researchers at Cardiff University working with the University of Liverpool\u2019s Institute of Translational Medicine, King\u2019s College London and Queen Mary University of London, added to the already mounting evidence that participating in lung cancer screening significantly increases the rate at which people quit smoking, at least among those already \u201cmotivated and receptive\u201d to the idea of quitting. It also confirms the findings of previous trials that a clean bill of health from a lung cancer screening does not falsely reassure smokers or reduce their motivation to stop smoking.\nFor the study, the researchers sent information packs to a random sampling of nearly 2.5 million British residents ages 50 to 75. The packs included a self-report questionnaire regarding lung cancer risk factors. From the questionnaire responders, 8,729 patients were identified as being at high risk for lung cancer. After they completed a second questionnaire to identify trial eligibility (among other things, people had to be smokers to be eligible) those who got the green light were either invited to participate in screening via CT scan or not, although all of those deemed eligible were offered standard leaflets and other information on how to quit smoking.\nCrunching the numbers after following up at two weeks and then again at two years, the researchers found 10 percent of the people who had been screened had quit after two weeks, and 15 percent after two years\u2014both higher than the 5 percent rates found in the group that had not been invited to participate in screening.\nAlthough smokers who quit after their screenings credited the screening with their quitting, the voluntary nature of the trial meant that smokers who took part were \u201cself-selected and may already have been contemplating quitting,\u201d the study authors note. That said, through the questionnaires, those who ended up quitting did have a marginal tendency toward feeling distressed over their smoking, which suggests that \u201cexperiencing a degree of concern about lung cancer may be necessary to galvanize cessation.\u201d Future evaluations of CT lung screening would therefore benefit from examining the influence of both mood and smoking-related thoughts and perceptions on quitting outcomes.\nFor now, the British researchers are confident in concluding that \u201cCT lung cancer screening for high-risk participants offers a teachable moment for smoking cessation\u201d and that for doctors and policymakers who are considering adding lung cancer screening to smoking cessation initiatives, this study adds to evidence suggesting that integrating CT screening with [other anti-smoking] interventions could really help smokers who are motivated to quit.\nInterested in quitting? Here are the ways your body heals when you quit the habit. And check out these anecdotes from ex-smokers on how they beat smoking before it beat them, and this expert advice on how to succeed at quitting","generate":"...about the impact it has on your health? Smoking is linked to a myriad of serious health issues, including heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory problems.

Your sense of taste and smell will improve, your skin will look healthier, and your energy levels will rise. It\u2019s never too late to make a change. Many people find support through friends, family, or professional programs that can guide you on this journey. \n\nConsider the benefits of a smoke-free life\u2014not just for yourself, but for your loved ones as well.

{"text":"First 3D printed human corneas\nThe first human corneas have been 3D printed by scientists at Newcastle University.\nIt means the technique could be used in the future to ensure an unlimited supply of corneas.\nAs the outermost layer of the human eye, the cornea has an important role in focusing vision.\nYet there is a significant shortage of corneas available to transplant, with 10 million people worldwide requiring surgery to prevent corneal blindness as a result of diseases such as trachoma, an infectious eye disorder.\nIn addition, almost 5 million people suffer total blindness due to corneal scarring caused by burns, lacerations, abrasion or disease.\nThe proof-of-concept research, published today in Experimental Eye Research, reports how stem cells (human corneal stromal cells) from a healthy donor cornea were mixed together with alginate and collagen to create a solution that could be printed, a \u2018bio-ink\u2019.\nUsing a simple low-cost 3D bio-printer, the bio-ink was successfully extruded in concentric circles to form the shape of a human cornea. It took less than 10 minutes to print.\nThe stem cells were then shown to culture \u2013 or grow.\nChe Connon, Professor of Tissue Engineering at Newcastle University, who led the work, said: \u201cMany teams across the world have been chasing the ideal bio-ink to make this process feasible. \u201cOur unique gel \u2013 a combination of alginate and collagen \u2013 keeps the stem cells alive whilst producing a material which is stiff enough to hold its shape but soft enough to be squeezed out the nozzle of a 3D printer.\n\u201cThis builds upon our previous work in which we kept cells alive for weeks at room temperature within a similar hydrogel. Now we have a ready to use bio-ink containing stem cells allowing users to start printing tissues without having to worry about growing the cells separately.\u201d\nThe scientists, including first author and PhD student Ms Abigail Isaacson from the Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University, also demonstrated that they could build a cornea to match a patient\u2019s unique specifications.\nThe dimensions of the printed tissue were originally taken from an actual cornea. By scanning a patient\u2019s eye, they could use the data to rapidly print a cornea which matched the size and shape. Professor Connon added: \u201cOur 3D printed corneas will now have to undergo further testing and it will be several years before we could be in the position where we are using them for transplants. \u201cHowever, what we have shown is that it is feasible to print corneas using coordinates taken from a patient eye and that this approach has potential to combat the world-wide shortage.\u201d\n\u2013ends-\nAbout Newcastle University:\nNewcastle University, UK, is a thriving international community of some 27,750 students from over 130 countries worldwide.

The breakthrough, achieved by a team of researchers, involves using bio-ink made from human cells to create corneas that closely mimic the natural structure and function of the eye. This innovative approach not only holds the promise of reducing the dependency on donor tissues but also addresses the growing demand for corneal transplants worldwide.\n\nThe 3D printed corneas have shown encouraging results in laboratory tests, demonstrating the potential to restore vision for those suffering from corneal diseases. As the technology advances, scientists hope to refine the process further, making it possible to produce corneas on a larger scale. This development could transform the lives of millions, offering hope to individuals who have long faced the challenges of impaired vision.

{"text":"RANGERS suffered their second home defeat of the campaign to Hibernian as Neil Lennon\u2019s side won 2-1 at Ibrox.\nThe Capital club were 3-2 winners in Glasgow earlier this term and goals from John McGinn and Jamie MacLaren earned them all three points on this occasion.\nRangers had pulled themselves level through Sean Goss but it was to prove another disappointing afternoon for boss Murty as he suffered another costly defeat on home soil.\nAfter seeing his side beat Fraserburgh in the Scottish Cup in midweek, Murty reverted to the line-up that had seen off Aberdeen and Ross County on Premiership duty following their return to action last month.\nIt saw in-demand Alfredo Morelos lead the Light Blues\u2019 attack once again but it was the players either side of him that had the first two openings of the game.\nJamie Murphy had a half chance to give the Gers the lead inside the opening 30 seconds, while Daniel Candeias saw an effort from the edge of the area blocked after four minutes.\nIt was a frantic start to what turned into an end-to-end first half as Hibernian once again went on the offensive at Ibrox and showed their own creative talents.\nWes Foderingham made a good stop from MacLaren, on to replace Brandon Barker, but was then left helpless as Florian Kamberi converted at the back post. Thankfully for Rangers, the offside flag saved them.\nIt was a reprieve the Gers couldn\u2019t make the most of, however, as Josh Windass spurned a glorious chance when he fired a shot at Ofir Marciano when he only had the Hibs keeper to beat. On the follow up, Murphy couldn\u2019t beat the Israeli either.\nHibs were causing Murty\u2019s side plenty of problems but the opening goal continued to elude them as Foderingham held an Efe Ambrose header and a low drive from Kamberi.\nOnce again, Rangers recovered to create a chance of their own. Windass picked out Candeias with a neat ball over the top but Morelos couldn\u2019t finish off the move as his weak shot was blocked by Ryan Porteous.\nThe first half didn\u2019t end goalless, though. Just four minutes before the whistle, the deadlock was broken and Hibs had a reason to celebrate.\nMcGinn nicked the ball off Candeias in the middle of the park, strode forward and found the bottom corner of the net with a strike that left Foderingham flailing.\nThe smattering of boos that greeted Murty\u2019s side at the whistle were followed by a rousing cheer as Ibrox welcomed Paul Gascoigne back once again.\nThe Gers legend received a warm round of applause from the home crowd but it was a goal that they really wanted to cheer as the action resumed.\nMarciano made another impressive stop to deny Candeias as he got his head on Murphy\u2019s cross, while a Windass effort was tame following a good run from Declan John.\nThe Welshman had the next attempt as a drive from 20y whistled by the left hand post. Minutes later, Goss\u2019 free-kick was just wide of target as Rangers continued to push.\nMurty\u2019s side finally had the ball in the net after 64 minutes but their celebrations were short lived. James Tavernier swung in a free-kick from the left and Morelos nodded home from a couple of yards but his goal was ruled out by the linesman on the Main Stand side.\nIt was soon time for Murty to turn to his bench in search of a spark. Greg Docherty made his Ibrox bow as he replaced Candeias, while Cummings took over from Jason Holt.\nThe stage was set for a storming finish. And Goss brought Ibrox to life as he pulled Rangers level with a stunning free-kick. Marciano got a hand to it, but he couldn\u2019t keep it out as the ball was curled into the top corner.\nJust seconds later, the Light Blues fans were silenced, though, and Rangers had it all to do all over again.\nTavernier fouled Scott Allan and referee Willie Collum pointed to the spot. MacLaren stepped up and his strike was too powerful for Foderingham as Lennon\u2019s side took the lead for the second time.\nThe closing stages were virtually one-way traffic as Rangers looked to salvage a point but their pressure and a series of half chances came to nothing.\nOnce again, it was an opportunity missed for Murty and his players as they fell six points adrift of Aberdeen in the Premiership standings.","generate":"...and they managed to replicate that success with another impressive performance. Hibernian took the lead in the first half when a well-placed header from their striker found the back of the net, sending their traveling fans into a frenzy. Rangers struggled to find their rhythm, and despite a spirited effort, they were unable to capitalize on their chances.\n\nIn the second half, Hibernian doubled their advantage with a stunning long-range strike that left the Rangers goalkeeper with no chance. The home side finally responded with a goal of their own, a powerful shot from inside the box that reignited hopes of a comeback. However, time was not on their side, and despite pushing for an equalizer, they fell short.\n\nThe defeat leaves Rangers with much to ponder as they look to regroup and bounce back in their next fixture. Meanwhile, Hibernian will take great confidence from this victory as they continue their pursuit of a strong season."}

Sean O\u2019Brien starts in his place with another chance to impress after his strong showing against the Crusaders last Saturday, while blindside flanker Peter O\u2019Mahony will captain the side in Warburton\u2019s absence.\nLions video diary day 14\nWith Warburton\u2019s position in the Test side currently in the balance, Gatland will used the run out against the Maori All Blacks to decide which of Warburton and O\u2019Brien deserves to start next Saturday, but confirmed that part of the reason why he stuck with the Welshman as his squad leader is he is wise enough to know if he hasn\u2019t earned the right to start the first Test.\n\u201cOne of the reasons we selected him as captain of the squad is that he is an absolute quality player but also, this tour isn't about Sam Warburton, it's about putting the squad first,\u201d Warburton said. \u201cIf he's not involved in the first Test because of the performance on Saturday night he will fully understand that.\n\u201cBut he'll get some game time and some opportunity to keep improving his match fitness because he hasn't had a lot of rugby in recent weeks.\u201d\nBritish and Irish Lions player ratings vs Highlanders\n15 show all British and Irish Lions player ratings vs Highlanders\n1\/15 Jared Payne \u2013 6 out of 10 Coped about as well as he could in the first half with the kicks that came his way and put in a big tackle to stop Waisake Naholo on the try line, but guilty of taking his eye off the ball when Sinckler made a great break. Getty Images\n2\/15 Jack Nowell \u2013 5 out of 10 Targeted defensively as the Highlanders repeatedly ran down his channel but did about as well as he could. Supported Webb well but could not out-run the scrambling defence. Getty Images\n3\/15 Jonathan Joseph \u2013 7 out of 10 Overcame a nervy start as Malakai Fekitoa took the fight to him, but finished the Lions\u2019 first try beautifully and also came to the fore defensively. Knocked on the final play of the game that probably didn\u2019t do his performance justice. Getty Images\n4\/15 Robbie Henshaw \u2013 6 out of 10 Caught out as he was left to defend two men when Naholo scored. Given the run-around by Fekitoa early but did well to chase the centre and kill off an overlap early in the game. Getty Images\n5\/15 Tommy Seymour \u2013 6 out of 10 Poor start as he failed to collect two simple high balls, and was also held up when he came into the field before crashing into the Landers pack. Given a bashing by Naholo, but did well to judge the flight of the ball and collect a Sopaga cross-field kick to score. Getty Images\n6\/15 Dan Biggar \u2013 7 out of 10 Strong start as his kicking was positive and landed a tricky conversion beautifully after Joseph\u2019s score. Bounced back from a heavy tackle from Li that saw him flick the ball on to Nowell smartly, and unfortunate to be replaced by Owen Farrell when he was lining up a penalty effort. Getty Images\n7\/15 Rhys Webb \u2013 6 out of 10 Glimpses of his best as he brought his awareness into the game, making one very good break down the blindside before offloading to Nowell. His box kicks remain too long though, and he at times tried to force the pass. Limped from the field short of the 50-minute mark. Getty Images\n8\/15 Joe Marler \u2013 6 out of 10 His presence on the field was more noticeable when he was off it as the Lions scrum struggled to cope after his departure. Strong in defence and tried to impose on scrum-half Kayne Hammington. Getty Images\n9\/15 Rory Best \u2013 5 out of 10 Suffered a cut to his head 25 minutes in that needed seeing to, but returned a few minutes later. Overpowered by his opposite number and also was hit backwards in the collision a few times, though his lineout accuracy proved solid. Getty Images\n10\/15 Kyle Sinckler \u2013 6 out of 10 One lung-busting surge into the opposition half went wasted when Payne knocked on the offload. Held up well in the scrum but cost his side three points with a shoulder charge on Coltman that proved costly. Getty Images\n11\/15 Courtney Lawes \u2013 5 out of 10 Did well to disrupt a lineout drive that led to a Lions turnover from Warburton, but knocked himself clean out soon after when he got his head on the wrong side trying to stop Waisake Naholo as he scored. Replaced by Alun Wyn Jones in the 26th minute. Getty Images\n12\/15 Iain Henderson \u2013 6 out of 10 He has a knack of trying to force offloads without looking, but his strong carrying saw him repeatedly cross the gainline. Getty Images\n13\/15 James Haskell \u2013 6 out of 10 Had to do his fair share of tackling as he wasn\u2019t given too much chance with the ball in hand. Battle with the Highlanders back-row was a close one that probably finished level. Getty Images\n14\/15 Sam Warburton \u2013 7 out of 10 Did well to disrupt the opposition ball in both the ruck and maul as he twice secured turnovers, and was smart enough to take the ball from the base of the ruck to score his try. Getty Images\n15\/15 CJ Stander \u2013 7 out of 10 Looked like a man who was playing in his third consecutive match as he was knocked backwards a few times and also caught in possession twice. Mighty in defence, but lacked his usual gusto going forwards. Getty Images\nAnother notable omission from the side is fly-half Owen Farrell, who initially joined Warburton among the replacements only to be ruled out of the game with a thigh strain. With Johnny Sexton given the nod at fly-half, the Irishman appears to have a strong chance of claiming the Test shirt, despite Farrell being the odds-on favourite to start against the All Blacks before suffering the injury.\nGatland decided against experimenting with the possibility of starting Sexton and Farrell together at 10 and 12, but he did suggest that there\u2019s \u201cevery chance\u201d they could play simultaneously at some point during the Test series, with the Kiwi determined to keep some of his selections a secret from the prying eyes of the All Blacks.\n\u201cThere's always those discussions, but we felt Owen's had a bit of rugby at the moment,\u201d Gatland explained. \u201cHe's on the bench and he's covering midfield options, so we could end up with the same situation as we did last week then we could have the 10\/12 combination, and we could end up with him coming on at 10 as well.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important for us is that at some stage he\u2019s going to get some game time, whether it\u2019s at 10 and continuing that, but for us even though it\u2019s a strong side we\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re not fully showing our hand, we\u2019re keeping some combinations back and keep the All Blacks guessing a little about what the final squad may be.\u201d\nSam Warburton is fighting for his place in the Lions Test team ( Getty )\nIn terms of the All Blacks side that was named on Thursday for their one and only warm-up against Samoa, Gatland was unmoved on Steve Hansen\u2019s selection with the team news being unveiled as expected, with Sonny Bill Williams returning for the first time since the 2015 Rugby World Cup final and both Brodie Retallick and Jerome Kaino fit to start after recovering from head and knee injuries.\n\u201cThat looks pretty close to their Test team I think,\u201d added Gatland. \u201cIt looks their strongest side and they're trying to get a game under their belt. I don't think they'll make too many changes.\u201d\nGatland is yet undecided on whether to travel back to Auckland to watch the match at Eden Park before returning to Rotorua in the early hours of Saturday morning, though he may be lured by the fact that his \u2018other\u2019 side, Wales, will be taking on Tonga before the All Blacks face Samoa in a double-header.","generate":"\"...up for grabs. The Lions head coach emphasized the importance of team dynamics and collective performance over individual accolades, particularly in light of Warburton's legacy as a former captain. Gatland acknowledged Warburton's contributions to the Lions but insisted that the focus must remain on the current squad's strengths and strategies.\n\nAs the team prepares for the challenging series against New Zealand, Gatland is keen to foster a competitive environment where every player feels they have a chance to earn their spot. He highlighted the depth of talent available, with several players pushing for selection in the back row. \n\nGatland's approach reflects a commitment to building a cohesive unit capable of taking on the formidable All Blacks.

{"text":"As Kanye West once again made headlines for insisting \u201cI do love Donald Trump\u201d in a reported conversation with a radio host, another of the rapper\u2019s statements was somewhat lost in the outrage, with people close to him reportedly concerned again about the state of his mental health.\nWest disclosed in that same conversation that he was addicted to opioids when he went through a high-profile meltdown in the fall of 2016. His breakdown led to his Saint Pablo tour being prematurely canceled and to his hospitalization \u201cfor his own health and safety.\u201d\nSpeaking on Hot 97 Monday, host Ebro Darden described his 30-minute conversation with West over the weekend, Billboard reported. Darden said West told him that he felt like \u201cnobody really showed love for me when I was addicted to opioids and in the hospital.\u201d\nBut people close to West deny he ever had an opioid addiction, according to The Blast. And those people also are concerned that West\u2019s statements about his \u201caddiction,\u201d his love for Trump and other recent \u201cerratic\u201d behavior are \u201cred flags\u201d that he may be suffering another \u201cepisode.\u201d\n\u201cWe are all worried about his current mental health,\u201d a source close to the singer told The Blast, saying alarms also were triggered by a recent outburst in his studio, in which West proclaimed that he didn\u2019t need people with \u201ctitles\u201d around him telling him what to do, saying he could \u201cdo it all myself.\u201d\nWest allegedly wrapped up his studio rant by announcing, \u201cYeezy is the new Apple,\u201d The Blast reported.\nDarden said West\u2019s remark about an addiction to prescription painkillers came up during a 30-minute chat, during which they covered a ranged of topics, including West\u2019s controversial statements about Trump.\nBack in November 2016, during a stop in San Jose on his Saint Pablo Tour, the hip-hop star drew boos and jeers from the crowd for his extended stream-of-consciousness rants, including when he proclaimed, \u201cIf I would have voted, I would have voted for Trump.\u201d\nWest subsequently canceled his tour and checked into UCLA Medical Center for eight days. He and his people never disclosed the reasons for his health crisis at the time. There was the standard \u201cexhaustion\u201d excuse. But there also were reports that he was \u201cprofoundly depressed and paranoid.\u201d\nIn documents filed in a lawsuit over the tour cancellation, Lloyd\u2019s of London suggested that West\u2019s breakdown was related to his use of prescription and illegal drugs.\nFollowing his breakdown, West resurfaced in public in December 2016 in a meeting at Trump Tower with the newly elected president, who was criticized for making incendiary racist, sexist and anti-immigration comments during the campaign. At the time, West explained on Twitter that he and the Republican leader met to \u201cdiscuss multicultural issues.\u201d West added, \u201cIt is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change.\u201d\nWest has recently returned to social media after a long absence. His much-noted return has included announcements about new albums from himself and others and his collaboration with Kid Cudi.\nBut West, the once \u201cpotently\u201d progressive musician, also has returned to making political statements that have prompted liberals to howl in outrage and conservatives, who never paid much attention to him before, to praise him as a \u201cbrave truth-teller,\u201d reported Atlantic writer Spencer Kornhaber.\nOn Saturday, West praised Candace Owens, a rising star in right-wing media who has criticized Black Lives Matters and who thinks Trump is the \u201csavior\u201d of Western civilization. West tweeted, \u201cI love the way Candace Owens thinks.\u201d\nI love the way Candace Owens thinks \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) April 21, 2018\nDarden said he brought up West\u2019s Owens comment during their conversation, accusing the husband of reality TV diva Kim Karadashian of \u201cliving in a bubble in Calabasas.\u201d\nSomehow, the subject of Owens prompted West to refer to a problem with opioid painkillers and to his perceived abandonment by friends and fans during his self-described substance abuse crisis. West\u2019s comment about his perceived abandonment comes at the 5:35 point in the clip below.\nDarden told West he was lying about people not showing concern for his well-being. \u201cI know people who personally reached out,\u201d he said.\nAt that point, West complained to Darden that he felt \u201cdemonized\u201d for \u201cspeaking out and challenging conventional thought,\u201d going on to tell him that he \u201cloves\u201d Donald Trump. The Trump comments begin at the 6.51 mark.\nThose close to West are reportedly outraged that he expressed support for Trump or for an alt-right pundit like Owens, saying such comments could hurt his standing in the hip-hop community, The Blast reported.\nOthers told The Blast they are worried that tweets and comments to Darden could signal he\u2019s headed to another crisis. They again insist that the breakdown he had back in November 2016 had nothing to do with an addiction. He was diagnosed at the time with an \u201cacute mental illness,\u201d a diagnosis he reportedly used in his defense in his lawsuit with Lloyd\u2019s of London, The Blast said.\nThis story has been updated.","generate":"\"...in the midst of his controversial remarks. West also expressed his desire for unity and understanding among people, emphasizing the importance of dialogue over division.

{"text":"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Browns coach Hue Jackson doesn't like the fact that his star receiver Josh Gordon got into it on social media with Packers cornerback Damarious Randall a day after the 27-21 overtime loss to the Packers.\n\"I would hope that we wouldn't [do that],'' Jackson said. \"I want us to do our talking on the field with our play. That's where the focus needs to be. because that's what it's going to take to get us to winning.\n\"Talking isn't going to do anything. I'm sure the emotions are high. We were close to having an opportunity. We didn't finish. He didn't really make a huge catch in the second half, so I think all of that stuff fuels into it, but I would advise our players let's not get caught up in social media and going bantering back and forth. Let's just continue to play and become as good as we can over these next three weeks.\"\nAfter the game, Randall told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel \"he had one catch, any more questions?''\nGordon, who caught three passes in the first half for 69 yards and then none in the second half, took exception to the slam and responded on Twitter.\nGreat Win for them but let's be serious.. Considering several of our disadvantages as a team, this kid couldn't hold my jock strap on my worst day lol..@RandallTime https:\/\/t.co\/ennvwjTMUH -- Flash Gordon (@JOSH_GORDONXII) December 11, 2017\nTo which Randall responded:\n[?] [?] You must be on that s--- again https:\/\/t.co\/l0MGVDqMri -- Damarious Randall (@RandallTime) December 11, 2017\nGordon's first two catches, a 38-yarder on the Browns' opening play and an 18-yard TD to cap the drive, came against zone coverage out of the slot. He caught one pass in man coverage against Randall, a 13-yard slant that led to a Duke Johnson TD catch in the second quarter.\nGordon had no catches the rest of the game, but was interfered with once at the goal-line by safety Josh Jones at the end of the half and didn't get the call. On the third play of the third quarter, Randall locked his arm and he dropped the ball with the other hand.\nRandall also jammed him at the line of scrimmage on the third-and-2 in overtime and then bear-hugged him. Kizer, who reversed field and rolled left, looked to his No. 2 option over the middle in Rashard Higgins, and when he tried to wave him further downfield for a possible TD catch, Clay Matthews hit Kizer's arm and the ball popped into the air. Green Bay's Josh Jones came down with it, and the Packers went on to throw the game-winning TD pass.\nJackson refused to say that Gordon was held on the play. But he did say Gordon was interfered with at the goal-line at the end of the half by Jones.\n\"It's very clear to me watching the tape that we wish that the call should have been different,'' he said. \"He definitely on the video tape we saw hit the offensive player before the ball got there.\"\nHe said the Packers didn't make adjustments to shut Gordon down in the second half. But they did roll Jones over to help Randall when they were in man.\n\"We attempted to throw and we called Josh's number several times,'' said Jackson. \"Sometimes the ball went someplace else. Sometimes they made a play. You saw the first third down of the second half, we tried to throw him the ball and the guy kind of had his arm locked. We couldn't get him there.\n\"There was the play at the end of the game. There were several other plays in between. The one where he got undercut down the left side, that ball was going to be for Josh. I don't think that they took him away. I don't think we executed at a high level as well as we did earlier.\"\nJackson also attributed some of Gordon's second-half drought to Kizer not looking his way enough. There were several times Gordon was singled up on Randall where Kizer could've take the chance.\n\"There were a couple of times DeShone had opportunities to throw him the ball that we didn't,'' said Jackson. \"Those are the things that DeShone has to maximize his opportunities on throwing the ball to Josh. We have to continue to grow that way.\"\nJackson said he had no problem with Gordon and then Corey Coleman wearing shades on the sidelines after their TDs.\n\"Honestly, football is supposed to be fun. I know it is fun when you are winning games and we all want more touchdowns and more celebrations, but I didn't [have an issue with it]. Obviously, I caught wind of it later than what it was. I'm sure it comes off of the [turnover chain] thing that the University of Miami did. Hey look, if that means those guys are going to keep scoring touchdowns, I will buy them some Ray-Ban glasses.\"\nGordon later threw a little shade on the folks who don't believe in him.","generate":"\"...after the team's loss. Jackson expressed concern over the distraction it could cause for the team as they prepare for their next game. 'We need to focus on what\u2019s important, and that\u2019s winning football games,' Jackson said during a press conference. He emphasized the importance of maintaining professionalism both on and off the field, especially in a challenging season.\n\nGordon, who has faced his share of personal struggles, took to Twitter to respond to Randall's comments, igniting a back-and-forth that caught the attention of fans and analysts alike. Jackson urged his players to channel their energy into their performance rather than engaging in social media disputes. 'We have to be better than that,' he added. The Browns are looking to rally together as a team, and Jackson hopes that this incident serves as a learning opportunity for Gordon and the rest of the squad as they strive to improve their record and build a cohesive unit.\""}
{"text":"This morning in New York City, the streaming giant Spotify -- which began publicly trading earlier this month and has a current valuation of $28 billion -- held a press conference to announce changes to the free version of its mobile app for both iOS and Android. The company hopes that these new features, which will be rolled out in the weeks ahead, will create a sizable increase in its user numbers globally.\nThe company says that these changes to music fans' experience on its mobile, ad-supported app \u2014 which include 15 personalized \"music discovery\" playlists in which listeners can hear full songs on-demand as well as an optional \"data saver\" function, which reduces the amount of mobile data the app uses by up to 75 percent \u2014 will entice even more users to its free tier. Spotify's in-house playlists, such as Rap Caviar and Viva Latino, are important drivers of exposure (and by extension, revenue) for record labels and artists.\nSome 90 million people currently use the free tier worldwide, while 71 million pay for its subscription service. As NPR has previously reported, 90 percent of the company's revenues come from subscriptions, not free listening.\nSpotify argues that a large uptick in free-tier users could result in big gains for content creators and rights holders \u2014 mostly in terms of potential exposure to new fans. Even so, referring to the recorded music industry's glory days of peak sales, Gustav S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m, Spotify's chief research and development officer, promised, \"This will make the 1990s look like a practice run.\"\nOverall, streaming is continuing to grow quickly: according to the 2017 International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) report, which was issued today, streaming revenue grew 41 percent last year, while download revenues declined by 20.5 percent and physical revenues went down 5 percent.\nDuring Spotify's investor-day presentation last month, Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek stated that his company was working on launching its platform in some of the world's most populous markets, including India, China and across Africa. The reduced data load that Spotify promised today has the potential to make its streaming services far more friendly to users in those countries.\nWith these moves, Spotify is continuing to employ the classic tech-company strategy of scale-before-profit in the hopes of holding onto its first place in the music streaming marketplace, while Apple Music has amassed its 38 million subscribers to its service in just less than three years.\nDuring a Q&A session with journalists that followed the presentation, Spotify executives were asked whether or not, with these changes to its mobile offerings and its emphasis on its free, ad-supported tier worldwide, the company would readdress or increase its payments to artists and labels. The answer was no.\nSpotify is positioning its free service as a competitor to terrestrial radio worldwide, not to mention more direct competitors such as Apple Music, and that Spotify pays more to artists and rights holders than terrestrial commercial radio does. S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m noted that radio was once the main vehicle for artist promotion, and that music fans then turned to record stores to buy music. Spotify's global head of creator services, Troy Carter (who formerly managed Lady Gaga and continues to manage Meghan Trainor, Kamasi Washington and Charlie Puth through his company Atom Factory), said that unlike the one-time profit that comes with selling a physical disc or vinyl album, streaming provides an ongoing source of revenue for artists. But, he acknowledged that with its much lower payout rates, streaming is a \"paradigm shift\" for artists. \"We're focusing on scale,\" Carter added. \"The bigger we get, the more we pay out.\"","generate":"...conference to discuss its ambitious plans for the future. CEO Daniel Ek addressed a packed room of journalists and industry insiders, emphasizing the company's commitment to enhancing user experience and expanding its content offerings. \"We believe in the power of music to connect people,\" Ek stated, highlighting Spotify's mission to be more than just a streaming service. \n\nHe unveiled new features aimed at personalizing playlists and improving discovery, ensuring that every listener can find something that resonates with them. Additionally, Spotify announced partnerships with emerging artists, aiming to provide a platform for diverse voices in the music industry. \n\nAs the event concluded, attendees were buzzing with excitement about the potential changes. Many expressed optimism about Spotify's role in shaping the future of music consumption, while others pondered the implications for artists and creators in this evolving landscape. The atmosphere was electric, filled with hope and anticipation for what lies ahead."}

The family decided to fly Ramirez to Texas on Aug. 4, and as Abreu says, the days leading up to the in-person reunion were taxing.\n\u201cThere were times I couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he says. \u201cI was tossing and turning and watching the hour glass get closer and closer to when I was finally going to see her.\u201d\nFor the two brothers, their mother and the reunion was everything they had hoped.\n\u201cI was biting my lip and sweating along my eyebrows,\u201d Abreu says. \u201cThat first embrace \u2014 my heart was racing as I was hugging her.\u201d\nFor Wiggs, it was a culmination of a decade\u2019s long journey that was powered by his instincts and determination.\n\u201cIt feels surreal, it just one of those things that I\u2019ve been thinking about for so long,\u201d Wiggs says of the meeting. \u201cAfter looking for all those years, it took time, it took energy, and it took so many emotions, but I can say, \u2018I did it.\u2019 \u201d\nThe brothers say they have been surprised by how much they have in common with Ramirez. She loves Bob Marley, just like they do, and she fits in perfectly with their sarcasm and humor. Most of all, though, they look forward to the mornings and nights that they will be able to say \u201cI love you\u201d to their mother, for many years to come.\n\u201cWhen she wasn\u2019t in my life, I used to pray that if Mom was up there in Heaven looking down on me, that she was my guardian angel and one day I would see her,\u201d Abreu says. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t have to say those prayers anymore.\u201d","generate":"...Michael Wiggs, 44, had spent years piecing together their family history, driven by a desire to understand their roots. Their journey began when they discovered clues about their mother\u2019s identity through social media and public records. With each lead, hope flickered brighter, but the fear of disappointment loomed large.\n\nFinally, after countless hours of searching, they received a message that would change their lives forever. Their mother, Linda, was alive and eager to reconnect. The emotional reunion took place in a small caf\u00e9 in Houston, where tears flowed freely as they embraced for the first time. \n\nLinda shared her story, revealing the circumstances that led to their separation, and the brothers listened intently, their hearts swelling with compassion. The bond they forged in that moment was palpable, filled with love, forgiveness, and the promise of a new beginning. Together, they began to heal the wounds of the past, cherishing the family they had longed for."}
{"text":"The latest episode of the Canadian Couch Potato podcast focuses on the relationship between cost and complexity in your investment plan.\nYou can often lower fees in your portfolio with a few simple changes that require no additional skill or effort. But there are times when accepting slightly higher costs in exchange for simplicity and convenience is actually a wiser choice. There's no single solution: every investor needs to find their sweet spot along that continuum.\nMy guest on this episode is John Robertson, author of The Value of Simple, which has just been published in a revised second edition. John's book does an excellent job of stressing these ideas. In the book-and in our interview-he discusses the various options available for investors looking to get started with indexing. These include the three options in my model portfolios, as well as a discussion of how robo-advisors fit into the landscape.\nFor those interested in comparing robo-advisors, John co-created a tool called AutoInvest.ca, which allows you to compare the all-in costs of the various options. This is not as straightforward as it might seem, as robo-advisors use different pricing models. I suggest clicking the \"Advanced Filters\" tab on the calculator to take full advantage of the tool. (You should also be aware that the site receives affiliate commissions.)\nJohn has also adapted this material into an online course called Practical Index Investing for Canadians. It expands on the ideas in the book and includes step-by-step tutorial videos showing you how to open new accounts and build your portfolio at Tangerine, TD Direct Investing and Questrade.\nSwitching to Vanguard's one-fund portfolios\nIn the Ask the Spud segment of the podcast, I take a detailed look at Vanguard's newly launched asset allocation ETFs. These funds, which I introduced in an earlier blog post, have led some investors to suggest they have made all other options more or less obsolete.\nCertainly these one-fund portfolios with a management fee of just 0.22% are among the most useful ETFs to come along in the last few years. But if you're successfully using an option such as Tangerine or TD's e-Series funds, make sure you understand the trade-offs. Using ETFs will always result in lower management fees, but these are not the only factor. Consider the following:\nThe size of your portfolio. Any time you compare annual fees, be sure to understand the differences in dollar terms, not just percentages. Lowering your fees from 1% to 0.25%, for example, makes a much bigger impact on a $100,000 portfolio than it does for someone who is still in the early stages of building wealth.\nHere's a rule of thumb you can use when considering whether to dump your index mutual funds in favour of the Vanguard ETFs: switching from the TD e-Series funds to one of the new ETFs will save you less than $2 a month for every $10,000 you have invested. Switching from Tangerine will save you closer to $7 a month.\nWhether you make regular contributions. One of the best ways to build wealth is to save a little every month and to have those contributions invested automatically. Index mutual funds and robo-advisors allow you to set up plans that automate this process, which has value for those who prefer being hands-off. You can't do this with ETFs, so your savings plan will not only involve more work, but also more potential to fall into behavioural traps. (\"Should I really invest this month with all of the volatility in the market?\")\nYour experience trading ETFs. Learning to invest with an online brokerage isn't terribly difficult, but it can be intimating and confusing if you have no experience placing orders on an exchange. Do you know the difference between a bid price and an ask price? Between a market order and a limit order? If not, take the time to learn before you bail on your user-friendly index mutual funds.\nThe number and types of accounts in your portfolio. If you're investing only in a TFSA or RRSP, or even both, then the new Vanguard ETFs are an excellent choice. But if you have a more complicated portfolio that includes multiple accounts for yourself and a spouse, then a one-fund solution is probably not ideal. More complex situations require more flexibility than a balanced ETF can offer. This is especially true if a significant amount of the portfolio is taxable, since the Vanguard asset allocation ETFs are not particularly attractive in non-registered accounts.\nYour target asset mix. The new Vanguard ETFs are best suited to investors who want to hold either 60% or 80% equities: those are the targets for the Balanced (VBAL) and Growth (VGRO) versions. If your target allocation is 50% or 70% stocks, there isn't an ETF with either of those asset mixes. And the Conservative version, VCNS, with 60% bonds, including a lot of U.S. and global fixed income, is not as attractive as the other two ETFs. If you're a conservative investor, I'd suggest adding some GICs to your portfolio instead of holding 60% bonds.","generate":"...a simpler investment strategy. By opting for low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investors can reduce management fees while still achieving broad market exposure. This approach not only minimizes costs but also simplifies the decision-making process, allowing you to focus on your long-term goals rather than getting bogged down in the complexities of individual stock picking.\n\nMoreover, a streamlined portfolio can lead to better emotional resilience during market fluctuations. When your investments are straightforward, it\u2019s easier to stay the course and avoid panic selling during downturns. The podcast emphasizes the importance of aligning your investment choices with your risk tolerance and financial objectives, ensuring that your strategy remains both effective and manageable. Ultimately, a well-structured, low-cost investment plan can empower you to build wealth over time without the stress of constant monitoring and adjustments."}

And white nationalist Preston Wiginton said he is planning a \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d rally at Texas A&M University in September.\nAlso, a neo-Confederate group has asked the state of Virginia for permission to rally at a monument to Confederate Gen. Robert E.

He was photographed at the rally behind a shield bearing the emblem of the white nationalist Vanguard America, though the group denied he was a member.\nTwo state troopers also died Sunday when their helicopter crashed during an effort to contain the violence.\nThe U.S. Justice Department said it will review the violence, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions told ABC that the death of counter-protester Heather Heyer, 32, met the definition of domestic terrorism.\nWhite nationalists said they were undaunted.\nHeimbach, who said he was pepper-sprayed during the melee in Charlottesville, called the event Saturday \u201can absolute stunning victory\u201d for the far right because of the large number of supporters who descended on the city to decry plans to remove a statue of Lee.\nHundreds of white nationalists, white supremacists, neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and others were involved, by some estimates, in what Heimbach, leader of the Traditionalist Workers Party, called the nation\u2019s biggest such event in a decade or more. Even more opponents turned out, and the two sides clashed violently.\nA neo-Nazi website that helped promote the gathering said there will be more events soon.\n\u201cWe are going to start doing this nonstop.

Today it\u2019s Confederate monuments. Tomorrow it may be the Constitution or the American flag,\u201d Schoep said.\nAt the University of Florida, where Spencer has asked to speak, President W.

Instead of power, he gets by on precision, guile and smarts.\nHendricks outpitched Strasburg in Game 1 of the NL Division Series, giving up only two hits in seven innings to help the Chicago Cubs open defense of their first World Series title in 108 years by beating the Washington Nationals, 3-0, on Friday night.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we call him Professor,\u201d Chicago second baseman Javier Baez said about Hendricks. \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\nKris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo produced RBI singles with two outs in the sixth inning for the first two hits off an otherwise-dominant Strasburg.

{"text":"It is clear now that Delhi Chief Minister has given up his brand of combative (AAP) supremo Kejriwal launched into an apology spree and apologised to Congress leader Kapil Sibal's son Amit Sibal and Union minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader for making unverified allegations of corruption against them. The development came days after Kejriwal apologised to former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia. After he tendered his apology, Kejriwal was acquitted in two separate defamation cases lodged against him by Amit Sibal, a senior advocate and son of former Union minister Kapil Sibal, and Gadkari. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, a co-accused with Kejriwal in the lodged by Sibal, was also acquitted after he, too, tendered an apology to the lawyer. Kejriwal intends to bring an end to the 33 defamation cases against him by means of similar out-of-court settlements and individual \"understandings\", say sources. According to AAP leaders, the various cases have drained the party's resources and money. The Congress and the BJP, however, hauled Kejriwal over the coals. The Opposition party advised that the Delhi chief minister should change his name to Arvind 'Sorry' Kejriwal, while the ruling party at the Centre lashed out at the AAP chief's brand of The AAP chief has been dragged to courts in multiple defamation cases lodged by various political leaders, including Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and former Delhi chief minister Kejriwal still has to contend with Jaitley's case, and sources in the AAP had told news agencies last week that the senior BJP leader could also soon receive an apology from the Delhi chief minister. Last week, Kejriwal wrote to Akali Dal leader Bikram Majithia, apologising for accusing him of being involved in drug trade without any proof to back the allegations. The apology, however, did not go down to well with everyone and triggered what amounted to a virtual rebellion in the AAP Punjab unit. Subsequently, Bhagwant Mann resigned as AAP's Punjab unit chief. However, things seem to have improved since Kejriwal's meeting with AAP members of the Punjab legislative Assembly, with most saying they understand the decision of the party's convenor. Amit Sibal had filed a defamation suit against Kejriwal and Sisodia for alleging that Kapil Sibal had a conflict in seeking to revise a tax demand on telecom major Vodafone. In 2014, Gadkari had filed a defamation suit against Kejriwal after the AAP chief named him in a list of \"corrupt politicians\". In the filed by Gadkari, it was alleged that Kejriwal had called him \"India's most corrupt\". Here are the top 10 developments in Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's apology spree that has so far covered Majithia, Sibal and Gadkari: 1) BJP says 'anarchic character' of Kejriwal's exposed: BJP's Delhi unit chief Manoj Tiwari took a dig at Kejriwal and his apologies, stating that the \"anarchic character\" of the \"NGO politics\" practised by the Delhi chief minister now stood exposed before the people of the country. Tiwari also alleged that Kejriwal was a regular violator of the law and that he had, in connivance with a section of the media preferring to run anti-establishment news, \"misused\" the Right to Information Act against his political opponents. 2) Shivraj Singh Chouhan has a piece of advice for the AAP chief: Kejriwal, who has received much ridicule over his apologies, given his past brand of politics, also received some advice on how to go about his apology spree. The Delhi chief minister's Madhya Pradesh counterpart, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, tweeted a piece of advice: \"Arvind-ji, if you heed my suggestion then make a list of people that you need to apologise to and prepare an apology letter headed 'To whomsoever it may concern'. \"This would save you the hassle of apologising repeatedly,\" Chouhan's tweet said. ALSO READ: Kejriwal's 'sorry' syndrome: Shivraj Singh Chouhan's advice to Delhi CM 3) Congress says AAP chief should change his name: The Congress on Monday advised the Delhi Chief Minister to change his name to Arvind 'Sorry' Kejriwal, adding that this is what happened when \"one does for sensationalism\". Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjwala said, \"There is a sorry Chief Minister in the country. He should change his name to Arvind Sorry Kejriwal. This is just the beginning of his trail of saying sorry, and not the end.\" \"He also has to apologise to the people of Delhi and the country, whom he has deceived,\" added Surjwala. \"He also has to apologise for poor governance. When you do only for sensationalism, and not for balance, then this going to be the consequence,\" said the Congress leaders, adding, \"The propaganda which was spread by him and his associates in collusion with BJP-RSS at Ram Leela Maidan during UPA rule, the truth of it has come out.\" \"Delhi is sorry to have Kejriwal and his government,\" he added. 4) Sisodia says don't want to waste time on defamation cases: Defending his party chief's apologies to Majithia, Gadkari, and Sibal, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister said on Monday that he would use his time in service of the people instead of doing rounds of the courts for defamation cases filed against him and Kejriwal. \"We will apologise to the people we have hurt. We're here to serve the people; we do not have the time to go to courts for such issues,\" said Sisodia, adding, \"We're here to build schools and hospitals for the welfare of people.\"\nALSO READ: Kejriwal says sorry to Gadkari, Sibal, Majithia; Arun Jaitley next? updates Sources have told news agencies that Kejriwal intends to bring an end to all the defamation cases against him, which reportedly number 33, by means of similar out of court settlements and individual \"understandings\". According to AAP leaders, the various cases have drained the party's resources and money.\n5) says Kejriwal backing off 'meekly': Displeased by his string of apologies, Displeased by his string of apologies, former AAP leader attacked Arvind Kejriwal , asking the AAP chief why he had published a list of 20 \"corrupt politicians\" if he wanted to \"back off meekly\". Further, Damania rejected Kejriwal's contention that he wanted to focus his strength in Delhi.\n\"Ideally, with a strong MLA force of 67 out of 70 MLAs, he should have entrusted the functioning of the Delhi government to his trusted MLAs and fought each one of the cases and ensured victory in every single matter and punish(ed) these corrupt politicians,\" she said. \"It is extremely upsetting to see Arvind seeking apology from Gadkari despite concrete evidences given by me. Why on the earth had the AAP issued a list of 20 most corrupt politicians if they were to back off meekly?\" added Damania.\nDamania was once a key associate of Kejriwal. She had accused Gadkari of irregularities in his Purti Group of companies. Kejriwal, for his part, had gone on to name Gadkari as one of the most corrupt politicians in India. Taking objection to this, Gadkari had moved the court against Kejriwal for allegedly defaming him.\nBesides spear-heading the campaign against Gadkari, Damania had also contested against him from Nagpur in the Lok Sabha polls 2014.\nALSO READ: Kejriwal apologises to Majithia; AAP, SAD-BJP leaders upset; 10 highlights Damania added that she still has 24 defamation cases against her and that she would fight them out until the end. Damania had quit AAP in 2015 at a time when the party was witnessing an ugly spat between and Yogendra Yadav on one side and Kejriwal on the other.\n6) acquitted in Gadkari and Sibal defamation cases: Despite the criticism, Despite the criticism, AAP's apology strategy does seem to be paying off , at least as far as dealing with the defamation cases is concerned, concerns over how it will impact the party's political image notwithstanding. Kejriwal was on Monday acquitted in the two separate defamation cases lodged against him by Gadkari and Amit Sibal after he issued an apology to both of them.\nAfter also tendered an apology to Amit Sibal through a letter, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Samar Vishal acquitted the deputy Delhi chief minister, who was a co-accused along with Kejriwal in the lodged by Sibal.\nThe relief came from the court after the apologies were accepted by the complainants in both the cases.\nALSO READ: Punjab AAP unit to support Kejriwal, other politicians miffed: 10 updates However, the proceedings against lawyer and BJP leader Shazia Ilmi will continue in the lodged by Amit Sibal.\n7) Kejriwal opposes second Rs 100-million defamation suit by Jaitley in HC: In the Delhi High Court, In the Delhi High Court, Kejriwal on Monday opposed the second Rs 100 million (Rs 10 crore) defamation suit against him by Arun Jaitley over the use of an objectionable word by the chief minister's former lawyer The AAP chief claimed that he had never instructed his then counsel, Jethmalani, to use any scandalous words against Jaitley during recording of his evidence.\nJaitley had filed the second defamation suit after Jethmalani allegedly \"abused\" him in the open court during the proceedings of the original defamation suit he had filed against the AAP chief and five other party functionaries.\nHowever, the chief minister maintained that apart from the ground of \"absolute privilege, the present suit is also barred by Section 126 of the Indian Evidence Act\".\n\"The statement, upon which the suit is based on alleged defamatory imputations made by the senior advocate (without any oath), allegedly on the instructions of the defendant (Kejriwal), which he could not have disclosed,\" Kejriwal said in his written statement filed through advocate Anupam Srivastava.\nSection 126 of the Evidence Act bars disclosure of any professional communication between an advocate and his client, including instructions given by the client in relation to his case.\nDuring the cross-examination of the minister on May 17 last year before Joint Registrar in the Delhi High Court, Jethmalani had used a term Jaitley found objectionable.\nALSO READ: Kejriwal's string of apologies continues, latest to Gadkari, Amit Sibal The second suit filed through advocate Manik Dogra has said that the minister enjoyed a reputation of honesty and probity and had sacrificed large professional earnings in order to undertake public service.\n8) Kejriwal apologises to Gadkari, Sibal: Days after Kejriwal regretted having accused Akali Dal leader Bikram Majithia of being involved in the drug trade, Days after Kejriwal regretted having accused Akali Dal leader Bikram Majithia of being involved in the drug trade, Kejriwal apologised to BJP leader and Union Minister and Congress leader Kapil Sibal for making unverified allegations of corruption against them. Both leaders withdrew their defamation cases against the AAP chief on Monday.\nIn a March 16 letter to Gadkari, Kejriwal said he was feeling sorry for making \"certain statements, without regard to its verifiability, which seem to have hurt you...\".\n\"I have nothing personal against you. I regret the same. Let us put the incident behind us and bring the court proceedings to a closure,\" said the letter.\nAddressing the Union Shipping and Transport Minister, Kejriwal also suggested that \"we should put our energy to serve the people of this country in the spirit of mutual respect\".\n\u091c\u0928\u0924\u093e \u0915\u094b \u0938\u092e\u091d\u0928\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0939\u093f\u090f \u0915\u093f \u0906\u0916\u093f\u0930 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947\u091c\u0930\u0940\u0935\u093e\u0932 \u091d\u0942\u0920\u0947 \u0906\u0930\u094b\u092a \u0932\u0917\u093e\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 ..@ArvindKejriwal is regular and habitual offender and this is his \"\u092e\u093e\u092b\u0940\u0928\u093e\u092e\u093e\" modus operandi \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0928\u0947 \u0907\u0924\u0928\u0940 \u0913\u091b\u0940 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0928\u0940\u0924\u093f \u0905\u092c \u0924\u0915 \u0928\u0939\u0940 \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0940 pic.twitter.com\/30hIUdZRQL \u2014 Manoj Tiwari (@ManojTiwariMP) March 19, 2018 Later, Gadkari and Kejriwal filed a joint application in the Patiala House Court, seeking the withdrawal of the \"Kejriwal has acknowledged that (the) complainant (Gadkari) was hurt on account of unverified allegations and expressed regret, in the larger public interest\" and that \"the complainant does not wish to pursue the defamation case\", read the application.

{"text":"As technology stocks sank on Monday, CNBC's Jim Cramer wanted to examine a name outside the line of fire: the stock of e-commerce platform Etsy.\nCramer was skeptical when Etsy first came public in 2015. But he changed his tune since the IPO, blessing the stock for speculation in May 2016 and recommending it again in August 2017.\nSince last August, shares of Etsy have climbed 78 percent, and Cramer argued that the move was totally due to the company's fundamentals \u2014 a good sign for prospective investors.\n\"A lot of people at one point were worried that Etsy would be steamrolled by Amazon after the retail 'Death Star' launched their own marketplace for handcrafted goods. Turns out Etsy is incredibly resilient,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\"We know that because Etsy's most recent quarter was a gigantic blowout,\" he continued. \"So any chance to buy this thing into weakness is an opportunity.\"\nAmazon's influence has proven to be a legitimate threat for online and brick-and-mortar retailers alike. But its push into the handmade market has not been enough to crush Etsy, which helps a network of nearly two million sellers compete in the digital retail space, Cramer said.\nMost companies that compete with Amazon fear the online giant's scale, but in this case, scale is on Etsy's side, the \"Mad Money\" host continued.\nEtsy has tens of millions of handmade goods for sale on its website; Amazon Handmade has less than one million, he noted.\nEtsy has also been improving the buyer experience with better search and recommendation functions, which translated into better holiday sales and growth across all of its core markets.\nBetter yet, the company's 2017 management shakeup \u2014 in which it brought in a new chief financial officer, a new chief technology officer and a new CEO \u2014 went off without a hitch, Cramer said.\n\"And boy, oh boy, can this new team deliver,\" he said. \"When Etsy reported its latest quarter last month, they knocked it out of the park.\"\nBeating earnings and revenue estimates, Etsy's fourth quarter showed better-than-expected gross merchandise sellers, growth in its mobile business and a higher conversion rate, or the percentage of consumers who end up buying something after visiting Etsy's website.\nManagement also gave strong full-year guidance for 2018, kick-starting a more than 30 percent run in Etsy's stock before Monday's weakness hit.\n\"That is an epic run, which is why I'm so glad Etsy's finally pulling back with the rest of tech, down 1.66 percent today,\" Cramer said. \"Ideally, it goes even lower and you get even better prices. I say 'ideally' because this sell-off has nothing to do with Etsy and I believe it will bounce back with alacrity once investors calm down.\"\nCramer acknowledged that shares of Etsy look expensive, currently valued at 53 times next year's earnings estimates. But based on the company's 2021 estimates, its valuation is only 29 times earnings, a better deal for a growth stock, he said.\n\"The bottom line? This was a really ugly day for the stock market, not denying it, but you need to stay calm. Approach sell-offs like this one as buying opportunities, at least when it comes to high-quality stocks of companies with great fundamentals,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\"Etsy's stock got hit today, but its business is in amazing shape.

And the latest doesn\u2019t look good.\nApple Inc.\u2019s five largest device assemblers reported a sharp slowdown after peaking at the end of last year, suggesting demand for the high-end device may have faded just a quarter after its release.\nWhile Hai Precision Industry Co., Pegatron Corp. and three other key suppliers reported an 8 percent rise in their total sales across the March quarter, growth cratered later in the period -- a drop that in the past has presaged a downturn for Apple.\nThe concern is that the iPhone X, while enjoying a customary holiday quarter spike for new-generation Apple gadgets, fizzled out rapidly. Apple\u2019s costliest smartphone has struggled to draw customers in emerging markets, while competitors from Huawei to Xiaomi roll out more premium phones and dominate China -- the U.S. company\u2019s biggest foreign market. On Friday, Morgan Stanley cut its estimate on iPhone shipments by 6 million, underscoring the growing unease since Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the maker of iPhone processors, issued a disappointing outlook that triggered a 7 percent loss in Apple\u2019s value over the past three days.\nRecommended Video: Now Playing:\nUpcoming: Apple might have a new iPhone SE in the works\nApple\u2019s sales growth bears close correlation with that of its main quintet of assemblers, which depend on the iPhone maker for their own business growth -- Hon Hai alone gets about half its revenue from Cupertino. While it\u2019s difficult to translate their numbers directly into Apple\u2019s, a look at reported figures since 2016 suggests it\u2019s possible to draw certain conclusions at the general health of the U.S. smartphone titan\u2019s top-line.\nThe group is responsible for finishing most of Apple\u2019s gizmos: Hon Hai, Pegatron and Wistron Corp. assemble iPhones. Hon Hai also has a role in other Apple products, splitting MacBooks with Quanta Computer Inc. and sharing iPads with Compal Electronics Inc. Quanta and Compal also make Apple Watches.\nmore techburger Get more tasty tech news at TechBurger. And follow us on Twitter and Facebook.

While Hon Hai, Quanta and Pegatron both rely on Cupertino for more than half their business, Wistron and Compal are far less dependent on Apple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In addition, as hardware mavens, their operations would have no impact on sales of software and services, a significant and growing part of Apple\u2019s top and bottom line.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that they are major assemblers of Apple but at the same time they have other customers,\u201d he said in an email.\nSour tune: Apple HomePod disappoints with slow sales\nInvestors remain concerned that iPhone sales at Apple, which reports results May 1, failed to meet their lofty expectations. Mia Huang, an analyst at Taipei-based research firm Trendforce, estimates that overall iPhone production volumes grew slightly to 54-56 million units in the March quarter -- barely up from 52 million in the same period of last year, when it was propelled by demand for lower-priced and older models like the iPhone 6S and ramp up of the iPhone 7.\n\u201cAccording to our estimates, iPhone X\u2019s production volume fell by 50% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter,\u201d said Huang.\nAMS AG -- which makes the optical sensors that control brightness and color -- became the latest Apple-supplier to cast doubt over the gadget\u2019s reception. Its shares tumbled after warning on negative operating margins because of low production capacity at its Singapore factories, which Baader Helvea AG analyst Guenther Hollfelder said suggested lower iPhone X volumes than anticipated.\nStill, the iPhone X\u2019s higher price tag ensured a tidy jump in revenue. For now, analysts are still counting on the first three months this year to have been Apple\u2019s best second quarter ever with an average estimate for $61 billion in revenue. And while its assembly quintet saw sales decelerate during the period, their collective growth is still double that of a year earlier.\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman\n\u00a92018 Bloomberg L.P.\nGet more tasty tech news at TechBurger.

Analysts suggest that the saturation of the smartphone market, coupled with economic uncertainties, is leading consumers to hold off on upgrades. This trend poses a significant challenge for Apple, which relies heavily on iPhone sales for its revenue.\n\nAs competition intensifies, particularly from brands offering high-quality devices at lower prices, Apple may need to rethink its strategy. The company has always prided itself on innovation, but with many users satisfied with their current devices, the pressure to deliver groundbreaking features is mounting. \n\nMoreover, the potential impact on Apple's supply chain and its ecosystem of services cannot be overlooked. A decline in iPhone sales could ripple through its other offerings, affecting everything from app developers to accessory manufacturers. As Apple navigates these challenges, the focus will be on how it can adapt and continue to engage its loyal customer base."}
{"text":"MUMBAI: State Bank of India SBI ) has reduced its staff headcount by 6,622 in the first quarter of FY18 to 2.73 lakh from 2.80 lakh at the beginning of the quarter due to retirements and a voluntary retirement scheme . The bank now plans to redeploy over 10,000 employees following the merger of its associate banks and due to digitisation.Consolidation of associate banks and a shift to digital channels for banking have set in motion a job restructuring process in one of the largest employers in the country. \"While the physics of the merger is over, the chemistry is yet to be completed,\" said Arundhati Bhattacharya , chairman, SBI, referring to the integration process after the merger of balance sheet which came into effect from the first quarter.A large part of the job restructuring is taking place on account of merger as the bank juggles its branch network to avoid having several outlets on the same street. SBI has merged 594 branches till August 6 and has rationalised 122 administrative offices. This in itself is expected to result in savings of over Rs 1,160 crore annually. The bank has entrusted a new entity\u2014SBI Infra Management\u2014the responsibility of managing its real estate assets.SBI is also finding the need to rationalise due to digitisation within and outside the bank. For instance, the bank is redeploying staff in government service branches as the Centre is shifting most of its banking operations to portals. Private lenders like HDFC Bank have been reducing their headcount at a much higher pace even as they push digital transaction. HDFC Bank's staff strength has come down from 90,421 in December 2016 to 84,325 in March 2017.In the first quarter of the current fiscal, the bank saw 7,247 employees exiting following retirements, including 3,569 employees of the erstwhile associate banks who were offered a voluntary retirement scheme. The bank had paid out Rs 473 crore ex gratia under this scheme which will result in salary savings of Rs 400 crore per annum. Of the staff redeployment planned by SBI, 2,000 will be because of shifting of administrative offices and another 8,618 due to branch rationalisation. Around 30% of the staff of rationalised branches will be redeployed in sales functions. The bank has introduced a new employee appraisal system where performers will receive financial incentives.The total employees of SBI and associates as on March 31 was around 2.80 lakh. The number has been stagnant for a couple of years as there has been a hump in retirements of large number of employees hired during the '80s. As against the exits, the bank has hired only 625 staff members in the first quarter, taking the total headcount down to 2,73,181. The number could further drop as full year retirements in FY18 are expected to be around 15,460. The bank is recruiting specialists for digital space and marketing though not in large numbers.The share of alternative (non-branch) channels in transactions has increased substantially from 76% a year ago to 80% on June 2017. The share of internet banking has increased from 24% to 30% of all transactions. Interestingly, ATM transactions are only 34% of transactions as against 43% a year ago.","generate":"...the fiscal year. This reduction reflects the bank's ongoing efforts to streamline operations and enhance efficiency in a rapidly changing banking landscape. The decision comes as part of a broader strategy to adapt to digital banking trends and improve service delivery to customers.\n\nWhile the reduction in workforce may raise concerns about job security, SBI has emphasized its commitment to reskilling employees and reallocating resources to areas that require more manpower, particularly in technology and customer service. The bank is also investing in automation and digital tools to better serve its clients, which may lead to new job opportunities in the future.\n\nSBI's management reassures that the focus remains on maintaining a strong workforce capable of meeting the evolving needs of its customers while ensuring that the bank remains competitive in the market.

{"text":"NEW YORK The U.S. stock market rallied sharply in the wake of President Donald Trump's election on Nov. 8, fueled by the hopes for his agenda of cutting taxes, spending on infrastructure and reducing regulations.\nBut since he took office, the road toward enacting these proposals has proved bumpy, and several of the early stock winners have faded.\nHere is a look at four \"Trump trades\" and how they have fared since his election and since his inauguration.\nOBAMACARE\nBarometer: Index of five hospital stocks (HCA Holdings (HCA.N), Tenet Healthcare (THC.N), Universal Health Services (UHS.N), Community Health Systems (CYH.N), LifePoint Health (LPNT.O))\nElection to inauguration: -7.1 percent\nInauguration to present: +4.1 percent\nPresident Trump's election sent shivers through investors in hospital operators because of his vow to immediately repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which benefited hospitals by expanding insurance coverage.\nBut passing healthcare legislation has proved to be not so straightforward even though Trump's fellow Republicans control both chambers of Congress - which has helped the stocks recover. Republicans in the House of Representatives had to pull their first attempt at a bill in late March in a surprising setback for Trump.\nThe effort seemed to gain fresh momentum on Wednesday as a reworked version won key support from the conservative House Freedom Caucus, with hospital stocks falling after the news, but congressional aides said Thursday that House leaders decided against holding a vote on the healthcare overhaul this week.\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nBarometer: Index of six infrastructure-related stocks (Caterpillar (CAT.N), Terex (TEX.N), Vulcan Materials (VMC.N), AECOM (ACM.N), Granite Construction (GVA.N), Nucor (NUE.N))\nElection to inauguration: +13 percent\nInauguration to present: +2.4 percent\nTrump's vow to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure helped lead to a windfall for many investors in industries such as construction, engineering, building materials and steel in the immediate aftermath of the election.\nTrump has maintained strong support for an infrastructure package, including earlier this month saying his overhaul could top $1 trillion on roads, tunnels and bridges, while promising to cut red tape to speed approval of infrastructure projects. But performance of the stocks has leveled off as an infrastructure package has not yet materialized, while there are indications that putting such a massive program to work could be easier said than done.\nBANKS\nBarometer: S&P 500 banks index .SPXBK\nElection to inauguration: +20.8 percent\nInauguration to present: +3.1 percent\nPerhaps no sector benefited as much from President Trump's election as banking in the immediate aftermath of his win. Optimism over his ability to roll back regulations boosted the group. Expectations that his agenda would stimulate the economy, promoting inflation and higher interest rates, also energized investors in banking stocks.\nBut after the stocks' big run, concerns about slowing loan growth have emerged for banks. Trump has pledged to roll back regulations and reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, but his struggle so far in Congress left doubts about whether he can push through such deregulation.\nEven though former Goldman Sachs executives populate his administration, Trump himself has been a bit of a wild card for banks, including recent comments that he would like to see interest rates stay low.\nTAX CUTS\nBarometer: Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks\nElection to inauguration: +12.6 percent\nInauguration to present: +5.3 percent\nTrump's plan to cut taxes broadly and reform the tax code gave investors reason to be optimistic about U.S. equities after his election, particularly investing in smaller companies that tend to be more domestically focused.\nThe promise of tax cuts is still driving the market, which has surged to near records in recent days as Trump was primed to propose slashing the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent. But Trump's struggle in his first legislative effort - repealing Obamacare - has sowed doubts about his ability to enact his plans.\nSince Trump started in office, investors have also expressed concerns that his involvement in international issues in Syria, North Korea and elsewhere would distract from his domestic agenda.\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Nick Zieminski)","generate":"and deregulating industries.

Analysts pointed to the challenges of passing significant legislation through a divided Congress, raising questions about the sustainability of the market's upward trajectory. \n\nDespite these uncertainties, many Americans remained hopeful, believing that a revitalized economy could lead to job creation and increased wages. Small business owners expressed optimism about the potential for tax relief, while workers looked forward to the possibility of new opportunities.
