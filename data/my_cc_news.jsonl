Mine went to my inner thighs for some reason \u2014 my thighs just got really angry one year.'\nReferencing an Instagram post from August 2015 where her stretch marks on her thighs could clearly be seen, she added that she didn't post her 'stretchies for the praise'.\n'I post[ed] it because [of] the wine also I like the pattern and they're so soft.'\nHowever that doesn't mean she's complacent when it comes to preventing them on her belly during pregnancy and shared that for her, it's all about prevention.\n'Sometimes, we only take care of our skin when we see a breakout happening, but with stretch marks, it's all about prevention,' she said.\nAnd she's a big fan of getting the whole family involved: 'I'm big now, so it's hard for me to bend over. John helps me a lot with everything at the end of the night.

I don't need money, I don't need anything \u2014 Lumi\u00e8re is just such an incredible product.'\nShe uses the brand's concentration on her belly, 'especially around the sides because you never know where stretch marks are going to pop up.'\n'The only place I don't have stretch marks on my body is my belly. The other places that have them are from regular wear and tear of my body,' she added.\nHowever, Chrissy also shared that she's never seen a woman without stretch marks, and detailed how every model she's worked with has had at least one.\n'I've worked with every supermodel in the world.

{"title":"Lifeguard receives Medal of Valor for heroic rescue","text":"OCEANSIDE \u2014 Lifeguard David Wilson was honored this week for a heroic water rescue that saved a life.\nThe rescue occurred July 17, 2016. Wilson was on unit patrol at Harbor Beach tower 14 along with veteran lifeguard Mike Wagner.\n\u201cIt was a pretty busy day,\u201d Wilson said.\nHe began his day instructing students in the Junior Lifeguard Program. He then continued to put in patrol hours due to sizable summer crowds and rough seas.\nEarlier that afternoon he was part of several land and sea rescues, including getting a child out of a locked sweltering car.\nThen came a distress call about a solo jet skier crashed on the jetty at the mouth of the harbor. The location of the accident is nicknamed the \u201cdevil\u2019s triangle\u201d due to the dangers the rock jetty poses.\nWilson responded and found the man thrown off the jet ski, semiconscious, wedged between two boulders and unable to free himself. He attempted to free the man as consistent sets of pounding waves hit him and the victim.\nWhile Wilson aided the victim a city harbor officer pulled up in a patrol boat and lent a hand in the difficult rescue. The two were able to put a lifejacket under the victim\u2019s head as a buoy.\nTo set the man free, Wilson needed to dive underwater and release the victim\u2019s legs. Eventually the pair dislodged the man, but not without getting knocked down by waves and enduring some major scrapes from the surrounding rocks, which Wilson described as a cheese grater.\n\u201cIt seemed forever, we got beat up pretty well, yelling \u2018brace\u2019 between waves,\u201d Wilson said.\nA city firefighter arrived and the three pulled the victim from the rocks between sets of waves, up onto a stretcher and to an awaiting air ambulance. Due to HIPPA privacy laws the name of the victim has not been released.\n\u201cNo doubt that without his iron effort, knowledge and skill in the ocean environment, a life would have been lost,\u201d Capt. Bill Curtis, Oceanside Fire Department Lifeguard Division, said.\n\u201cDavid knowingly placed himself in harm\u2019s way with one goal and an incredible outcome.\u201d\nFor most the work day would end there, but Wilson showered off his cut leg and returned to duty to help with an issued code five alert. That afternoon he pulled 20 people from the harbor\u2019s choppy waters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the crazier situations I\u2019ve been in,\u201d Wilson said.\nCode five rescue operations involved every lifeguard on duty. Wilson said to aid multiple people in distress his partner paddled out on a rescue board, directed a group of five people to hold on and Wilson swam two of them at a time into shore.\n\u201cIt was a good day with a positive outcome,\u201d Wilson said.\nDespite his long day and injuries Wilson was at the Junior Lifeguard Program the following morning instructing potential future guards.\nThe recognition ceremony for his heroism took place in Sacramento on Sept. 25. Out of 21 applicants Wilson was the only one to receive the prestigious Governor\u2019s Public Safety Medal of Valor this year.\nWilson grew up in Oceanside and has served as a city lifeguard since 2012. He just completed criminal justice studies and plans to pursue a career as a State Beach peace officer ranger\/lifeguard.\nHe said his career path was inspired by fellow Oceanside lifeguards whose rescues have become legend.\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of people in this profession who get recognized for their amazing feats,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI\u2019m beyond blessed being able to do this.\u201d\nLast year Oceanside beaches saw more than 4 million visitors.

At this point, the raft\u2019s rope became tangled in a piling and Wilson was pulled off the jetty into the water.

Specifically, the two organizations will help standardize and improve cloud security vendor reviews by promoting and strengthening the CSA's Security, Trust & Assurance Registry (STAR) and related CSA tools as recommended practices for cloud security and vendor evaluations.\n\"We are excited to partner with the NTSC to make common cause toward raising the bar for cloud computing security and all new emerging technologies,\" said Jim Reavis, CEO of Cloud Security Alliance. \"CSA STAR is the world's largest cloud computing assurance program which, combined with NTSC's focus on CISO advocacy, will help accelerate trust of the cloud while preventing key stakeholders from reinventing the wheel.\"\nThe NTSC and CSA are seeking to streamline the vendor security review process; reduce time, energy, and effort by encouraging best practices for vendors; and offer benefits to vendors who abide by this process and best practices. Together, the organizations will collaborate on a STAR-based questionnaire that maps to the most used compliance frameworks. A joint whitepaper will then provide information about this program, how CISOs can incorporate this program into their companies, and how vendors would incorporate the program when planning to work with organizations.\n\"The information security industry needs to evolve the way it assesses and improves cloud vendor security,\" said Patrick Gaul, Executive Director of the NTSC. \"CISOs don't have the same kind of transparency with third party cloud security vendors as they do with their own network systems. I'm excited that the preeminent CISO and cloud security auditing associations are partnering together, and we look forward to promoting a more rigorous way to help CISOs vet cloud security vendors based on CSA's successful STAR program.\"\nIn addition to partnering on a cloud security vetting program, the CSA and the NTSC will also participate in each other's events, discuss industry issues in working groups, and collaborate on research involving cloud security. The NTSC encourages dialogue about cybersecurity issues, laws, and regulations through advocacy engagement with congressional members, regional CISO policy roundtables, and an annual DC Fly-In as part of its National CISO Policy Conference. The CSA holds many conferences, summits, events, and forums around the world to promote the use of best practices for providing security assurance within cloud computing.\nAbout Cloud Security Alliance\nThe Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is the world's leading organization dedicated to defining and raising awareness of best practices to help ensure a secure cloud computing environment. CSA harnesses the subject matter expertise of industry practitioners, associations, governments, and its corporate and individual members to offer cloud security-specific research, education, certification, events and products. CSA's activities, knowledge and extensive network benefit the entire community impacted by cloud \u2014 from providers and customers, to governments, entrepreneurs and the assurance industry \u2014 and provide a forum through which diverse parties can work together to create and maintain a trusted cloud ecosystem.\nAbout the National Technology Security Coalition (NTSC)\nThe National Technology Security Coalition (NTSC) is a non-profit, on-partisan organization that serves as the preeminent advocacy voice for Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) across the nation.

Billy Graham in the soaring Capitol Rotunda, paying tribute to a man who ministered to presidents and other Americans of both parties.\n\u201cHere lies America\u2019s pastor,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan, gesturing to Graham\u2019s casket under the eye of the dome, surrounded by family, friends, lawmakers and a ring of paintings of the nation\u2019s founders. \u201cHe ministered to all walks, from some of the greats whose statues line this hall_Eisenhower, King, Ford, and Reagan_to the everyday citizens lining up today to pay their respects.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump said his father was an admirer of Graham\u2019s and that the \u201clegendary\u201d American figure deserved to be recognized in the place \u201cwhere the memory of the American people is enshrined.\u201d\nGraham\u2019s influence stretched far beyond the city where he counseled lawmakers to a global flock over the better part of seven decades.\n\u201cThe man we recognize today shared the Gospel with more people, face-to-face, than anyone else in history,\u201d said Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\nAs the leaders stood by the casket, Trump reached out to touch the bare wood and Ryan bowed his head.\nGraham died a week earlier at age 99. Some 30 family members are accompanying Graham\u2019s casket to Washington, where he befriended presidents of both parties and counseled others over seven decades. Graham\u2019s son, Franklin, tweeted a photo Wednesday of family members loading the casket onto a jet emblazoned with \u201cSamaritan\u2019s Purse,\u201d the name of a Christian relief charity that he chairs.\nGraham is lying in honor before a funeral Friday near his home in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Rotunda entrances were draped with black fabric, and Graham\u2019s casket rested on a black-draped catafalque beneath the soaring ceiling and its painting, the \u201cApotheosis of Washington.\u201d\nThough he met every president since Harry Truman and counseled most, Graham grew wary of politics after Watergate. He was closest to Richard Nixon but later said he felt used by him.\nNonetheless, Graham ministered to other presidents until his health began to fail about 10 years ago.\nFormer President Bill Clinton recalled seeing one of Graham\u2019s crusades as a child, a profound experience that became more amazing over his life. Graham counseled him as Arkansas governor, and later as president in the White House itself.\n\u201cIn that little room, he was the same person I saw when I was 11 on that football field,\u201d Clinton said Tuesday after viewing the casket at Graham\u2019s home.\nFormer President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, also visited Graham\u2019s home on Tuesday.\nIn Washington, Ryan said there had been no doubt that Graham would receive the honor of a public viewing in the Rotunda. He told reporters that almost immediately upon hearing of Graham\u2019s death he, Trump, McConnell and Rep. Patrick McHenry, who represents the Graham family\u2019s district, agreed it would happen.\nGraham shares the honor with 11 presidents and other distinguished Americans, starting with Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky in 1852 and, most recently, Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii in 2012, according to the House and the Architect of the Capitol.\nGraham is only the fourth private person to lie in honor since 1998. The others are two U.S. Capitol Police officers who died in the line of duty in 1998 and civil rights hero Rosa Parks in 2005.\nTrump met Graham at the pastor\u2019s 95th birthday party in 2013, but is closer to Franklin Graham Jr.\nOn Friday, Trump was to attend Graham\u2019s funeral near his library in Charlotte, North Carolina. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush will not be there, meaning no former presidents will attend the funeral.\nFollow Kellman at http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/APLaurieKellman","domain":"www.dailybulletin.com","date":"2018-02-28 17:34:07","description":"","url":"https:\/\/www.dailybulletin.com\/2018\/02\/28\/graham-wary-of-politics-in-life-gets-rare-capitol-salute\/","image_url":"https:\/\/www.dailybulletin.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/billy_graham_25513409-1.jpg?w=1024&h=779","meta-llama-Llama-2-13b-hf_generated_text_wo_prompt":"ing final respects to a man whose influence on American life was as towering as his famous lanky frame.\nThe honor granted Graham, a confidant to 12 presidents, was as impressive as any president bestows.

He was a confidant to U.S. presidents going back to Harry Truman, through the years of Cold War confrontation and the culture wars of the past few decades.\nGraham, who died at the age of 99 on Feb. 21 at his North Carolina mountain home, was honored with the rare distinction of lying in honor in the Rotunda, reserved for presidents, certain other government leaders and private citizens of extraordinary national significance.\nBill Clinton called Graham a \u201cgreat American\u201d and \u201ctrue Christian.\u201d\nHillary Clinton noted that she was the first children\u2019s lawyer in the country to work with Graham in the 1980s, traveling on behalf of a children\u2019s literacy program.

We would be handcuffed and helpless and that is not the way America came to be or the way our nation should remain.\nDaniels has previously blasted gun control in wake of mass shootings. After June\u2019s Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, Daniels wrote in an editorial for The Washington Times that guns are \u201cthe great equalizer\u201d for those who want to protect themselves and their fellow citizens.

While Daniels argued that automatic weapons can be used for self defense, he wrote that the only weapon used by the attacker at Chattanooga was fully automatic. Daniels wrote that \u201cour legislators should consider making it very difficult for anyone to purchase fully automatic firearms unless they are law enforcement, the military or a licensed hunter.\u201d\nOn Monday, in an unrelated editorial in The Washington Times, Daniels wrote that the Las Vegas shooter\u2019s actions \u201cwill become nothing more than another blip on the news barrage, another headline in an unending river of heartbreak.

{"title":"BAFTAs 2017: the best jewels from the red carpet","text":"Britain\u2019s red carpet night for the stars of the silver screen took place last night at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in attendance at the 70th edition of the BAFTAs. This was the first time the royal couple have been together on this red carpet, turning up the heat on the jewellery front, and Kate didn\u2019t disappoint. Confirming the red-carpet trend, Kate chose large earrings over a statement necklace worn with her off-the shoulder floral print gown by Alexander McQueen.\nThe Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s large chandelier earrings have us all guessing. According to the Daily Mail, Kensington Palace will not comment on whether they were a loan or from the Duchess\u2019 own jewellery box, but they have had previous outings. Our hunch is that the jewels are by a British designer and that the pink stones are morganites \u2013 the Duchess has shown a preference for pastel-coloured gems \u2013 surrounded by old-cut diamonds.\nThese classic yet so very Kate earrings were possibly commissioned by the Duchess herself, but no jeweller worth her commission would dare to spill the beans, so we will just have to keep guessing. The articulated diamond bracelet looks like it might be an Art Deco jewel from the Queen\u2019s personal collection. She was, of course, wearing her sapphire engagement ring.\nBeyond the excitement caused by the Duchess of Cambridge, bold embroidered floral motifs on gowns were the main couture trend, dominated by Alexander McQueen, Gucci, Dior and Tom Ford. With embellished dresses a strong style statement, glamorous earrings to complement the decorative flourishes as opposed to showstopper necklaces marked the night.\nAfter the Duchess of Cambridge, Emily Blunt was the most polished example of how to pair an elaborate gown with jewels. She wore her Alexander McQueen gown with Lorraine Schwartz jewels. In her lobes were a pair of 50-carat blue sapphire earrings and on her finger, a playful, lifesize, lifelike dragonfly ring that looked as if it had just fluttered out from the Oriental garden embroidered on her dress.\nBulgari picked a winner as Viola Davis, below, raised her prize for Best Supporting Actress wearing a diamond Serpenti bracelet coiling up her arm and matching earrings along with her striped, flowing chiffon Jenny Peckham gown. Felicity Jones chose a more discreet look with Bulgari diamonds studs and ring.\nViola Davis, Best Supporting Actress winner at the BAFTAs, accessorised her electric-blue Jenny Packham gown with a high jewellery Serpenti bracelet and earrings, both by Bulgari.

Credit: Getty Images\nEmma Stone picked up her award for Leading Actress in a Chanel ensemble of dress and trousers with barely any jewellery visible apart from some discreet Tiffany diamond earrings and a pearl anklet.\nBucking the trend for opulent embroidery, Nicole Kidman,top, nominated for her role in Lion, turned up in a sleek, daringly deep-cut, slit-to-the-navel number by Giorgio Armani to show off 67 carats of diamonds in the Harry WinstonCaftan necklace.\nPenelope Cruz, draped in a shimmering golden gown, added a pop of colour with a rubellite and diamond ring from Chopard\u2019s Temptations collection.\nChopard, never far from a red carpet, bejewelled Penelope Cruz, above, and Isabelle Huppert, below. Cruz, draped in a golden gown of many swags, added a pop of colour with a candy-bright rubellite and diamond ring from the aptly named Chopard Temptations collection. French actress Isabelle Huppert also wore Chopard, with 68 carats of emeralds and 14 carats of diamonds in her lobes alone.\nIsabelle Huppert\u2019s BAFTAs jewels included these shoulder-grazing Chopard high jewellery emerald earrings, which feature diamond stars raining down from both ears.\nStar Wars heroine Daisy Ridley, below, scrubbed up and shone in chic Roland Mouret, paired with a bold yet simple Cartier Nouvelle Vague black lacquer and diamond cuff and two pairs of diamond earrings in her ears.\nStar Wars heroine Daisy Ridley shone in chic Roland Mouret, paired with a bold yet simple Cartier Nouvelle Vague black lacquer and diamond cuff and two pairs of diamond earrings in her ears.\nWith each publication, JK Rowling grows ever more glamorous and looked a true celebrity on the red carpet in her deep-pink, floor-sweeping Roland Mouret gown. Showing a very personal take on jewellery styles, Rowling chose an edgy Yprem diamond hand bracelet \u2013 something of a speciality for this Lebanese jewellery house \u2013 with big diamond swirl earrings.\nNew-to-the-scene jeweller, Kat Florence, sponsored the after party, where Amy Adams posed with her for the obligatory sponsor\u2019s shot wearing David Webb jewels and Millie Brady donned a pair of Kat Florence Tropicana diamond drop earrings.","domain":"www.thejewelleryeditor.com","date":"2017-02-13 00:00:00","description":"From the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s large and mysterious earrings to Nicole Kidman\u2019s daring diamonds, we bring you an insider's take on\u00a0the best of the BAFTAs.","url":"http:\/\/www.thejewelleryeditor.com\/jewellery\/article\/baftas-red-carpet-jewellery\/?utm_source=googlenews&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=googlenews","image_url":"http:\/\/www.thejewelleryeditor.com\/static\/img\/favicon\/favicon.ico","meta-llama-Llama-2-13b-hf_generated_text_wo_prompt":", hosted by Joanna Lumley.\nWhile it\u2019s safe to say there were quite a few shocks and surprises on the night, especially with three of the five Best Picture nominees winning absolutely nothing, the most talked-about looks came from some of the biggest stars in attendance.\nJeff Bridges was the epitome of cool casual as he arrived with his Best Supporting Actor award and walked away with a Special Award for his services to cinema. \u201cAs I say to my wife when she goes out in the morning and she looks in the mirror: She\u2019s the prettiest girl in the world.\u201d he quipped.\nViola Davis became the first black actress to win a Leading Actress BAFTA Award, taking the accolade for her role in The Help.

She chose to go for a black-and-white 1920s beaded gown by Nina Ricci to take home her award \u2013 which we think was the perfect choice.\nMeryl Streep, who picked up her 13th BAFTA, looked beautiful in a strapless Alexander McQueen gown with her glossy dark hair pulled back and pinned up in the back.\nThe best dressed men of the evening were Javier Bardem and Tin Tin\u2018s Jean Pires, who both wore Gucci tuxedos. Bardem had a lilac and purple check tie to break up the color.\nIt\u2019s hard to look at a beautiful face like Keira Knightley and not want to call her plain, but that\u2019s what we can do.

(Photo: Michael Chow\/azcentral sports)\nAs anyone with 175 career games under his belt surely knows, nothing lasts forever. Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer knows he isn\u2019t getting any younger.\nThe veteran had most of his best years with the Bengals but, after a trade from Oakland to Arizona in 2013, he led the Cardinals to a 10-6 season \u2014 their best record since 2009.\nHe posted a 63.3 completion percentage for 4,274 yards, his best passing efficiency since 2007 (64.9 percent) and a then-career high in single-season passing yards.\nMORE: Bickley: Cardinals' Carson Palmer can't wait for his last shot\nPalmer suffered a torn ACL that derailed his 2014 season but Palmer was better than ever in 2015.\nThe veteran set career highs in wins (13), passing yards (4,671), yards per attempt (8.7) and QBR (78.6). Pro Football Focus named him a first-team All Pro; Palmer had never been named to any all-pro team by any publication.\nHowever, the 37-year-old quarterback experienced a clear decline in performance in 2016, posting career lows since his time in Oakland in categories across the board.\nCardinals coach Bruce Arians talks with Carson Palmer (3) during a game against Washington on Dec. 4. (Photo: Michael Chow\/azcentral sports)\nThe drop-off has called into question Palmer\u2019s chances for a bounce-back season.\n\u201cI feel great. My body feels great like everybody in the league right now,\u201d Palmer said in a conference call on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m excited about this year, this group and the opportunity in front of us.\u201d\nFor Palmer, feeling is everything. For a player fifth among active quarterbacks in sack percentage (5 percent), it\u2019s important to apply regular oversight to his health.\nIn fact, Palmer has been performing his yearly self-checkup since before his breakout 2015 campaign. The inflated numbers were nice to have, but it didn\u2019t change how he viewed the rest of his career.\nMORE: Cardinals' Carson Palmer says age is relative at QB position\n\u201cI\u2019ve been telling my wife (for years) that this is the last one, but I take it one year at a time,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cI go through a process at end of the season to take stock.\u201d\nWith lower expectations and an optimistic mindset, Palmer is looking to get back to doing what he loves \u2014 just playing the game.\n\u201cI love the game, working out, studying, every facet of it,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cAs long as I have the ability and the health to play, and continue to enjoy it, I don\u2019t want to stop.\u201d\nThe underdog\nPalmer believes the Cardinals\u2019 7-8-1 record in 2016 could be the best thing to happen to the team \u2014 and to him.\nIt\u2019s an interesting disposition, especially considering that just a season prior the Cardinals claimed their first NFC West title since 2009 and won 13 games for the first time in franchise history. They also earned a first-round bye in the playoffs, another first for Arizona.\nThe Palmer-led Cardinals made a statement with a 26-20 overtime win over the Green Bay Packers in the divisional round at University of Phoenix Stadium, but could not contain Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers in a 49-15 road drubbing in the NFC title game.\nMORE: Cardinals had more fun this spring, Bruce Arians says\nStill, expectations remained high for the Cardinals entering 2016.\nThis, Palmer maintains, spelled doom for him and his teammates. But this year, the 14-year veteran signal caller is looking forward to being in a familiar role.\n\u201cI prefer the underdog role, and people are talking about other teams this year,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cIt allows you to go about your work, not having to answer some questions that come with a 13-3 season.\u201d\nPalmer can feel the difference.\n\u201cI think there is definitely (less pressure),\u201d Palmer said. \u201cComing off a below .500 season, it gives you a little more time to focus on your craft, doing your job, and I think our team prefers the underdog style as well.\u201d\nMORE: Carson Palmer on NFL's highest paid player list","domain":"www.azcentral.com","date":"2017-06-28 18:37:22","description":"At 37 years old, Carson Palmer has more years behind him than in front.

Here are three things the Cardinals need to focus on heading into Week 6, against the Seattle Seahawks.\n1. Run defense\nThings are going to be rough this week without Chandler Jones, who will miss a couple of weeks while on the COVID list. It\u2019s been an interesting year for Jones; while he has continued to play very well overall, he has had some sacks and quarterback hits wiped out by referees\u2019 incorrect calls. Still, the defense will miss Jones\u2019 presence and the fact that the Cardinals do not have a single proven pass rusher behind him.\nIt\u2019s not ideal that the Cardinals\u2019 best pass rusher will not be on the field when they travel to Seattle to face the Eagles\u2019 offense. And for all their flaws, the Seahawks\u2019 offense is better than the Eagles\u2019 by quite a bit.\nSports Illustrated NFL Power Rankings: Cards Rise, Cowboys Rough Up\nJ.J. Watt Has Made This New Cardinals Team His Own\nThat\u2019s why the Cardinals\u2019 poor run defense was a problem this week. The Cardinals have the No. 4 run defense by DVOA this season and they have given up 445 rushing yards through four games. But they also have not faced a true run-first team yet this season, and the Eagles have the No. 3 run offense and rushed for 222 yards and averaged 5.1 yards per carry against Arizona.\nEzekiel Elliott is one of the most talented backs in the NFL, and he averaged just 2.9 yards per carry. Jonathan Taylor of the Indianapolis Colts averaged 4.3 yards per carry.\nAaron Jones of the Pack"}

That\u2019s down 0.2% from the $142.15 a share estimate that was forecast at the end of June.\nForecasts have come down even more for the remainder of the current year. For 2017, analysts see earnings of $130.46 a share for the S&P 500. That\u2019s down 3.5% from the $135.25 that was forecast at the end of April. The S&P has risen 3.5% since that date.\nIt isn\u2019t uncommon for estimates to be pared back as analysts and investors get more clarity about what economic conditions will look like, and the current tapering of expectations is less severe than is typical. The 0.2% decline for 2018 earnings is narrower than the 2% reduction that is typical when investors look out to the coming year, while the view for the second half of the year is also milder. Whereas forecasts have come down by 4% since March, per Goldman, the 30-year average reduction in estimates is 9%.\nOpinion: The charts say S&P is heading into a \u2018treacherous\u2019 pullback\nDespite that, the investment bank\u2014led by chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin\u2014expects 2018 forecasts to drop 5% from current levels. In particular, it wrote that the market consensus was \u201coverly optimistic primarily on energy earnings growth.\u201d\nEven though major U.S. stock-market indexes rose throughout the second-quarter earnings season, with both the Dow DJIA, +0.62% and the Nasdaq COMP, +1.34% hitting records, there were signs that investors were unimpressed even with better-than-expected results in the quarter.\nAccording to data from BlackRock, U.S. companies that topped consensus forecasts on both earnings and sales barely rose in the day after their earnings, relative to their benchmark. In the first quarter, such companies outperformed by nearly 1%, in aggregate.\nIn comparison, stocks from Europe, Japan, or emerging markets that posted better-than-expected results saw much more pronounced rises in the second quarter. Meanwhile, U.S. companies that just missed on revenue sold off more than stocks from other regions that did, while the names that reported worse-than-expected results on both metrics were sharply punished following the results.\n\u201cEquity markets have greeted positive earnings reports largely with indifference. Investor sentiment shows more signs of fatigue than euphoria, even as stock markets have repeatedly reached new highs this year,\u201d said Richard Turnill, BlackRock\u2019s global chief investment strategist.\nInvestors \u201cmay be on to something,\u201d he added. \u201cIt will be more difficult for companies to achieve the same EPS growth in the second half, as the earnings recovery in the second half of 2016 is a higher hurdle.\u201d\nDespite that, he forecast \u201csolid fundamentals and returns\u201d going forward, \u201cwith the latter largely tracking earnings growth.\u201d","domain":"www.marketwatch.com","date":"2017-08-14 16:39:00","description":"Despite the strength in the quarter, results in the first half of the year \u201chave not been strong enough to warrant positive S&P 500 [earnings per share] revisions,\u201d Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients.","url":"http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/stock-rally-is-occurring-against-a-backdrop-of-falling-profit-forecasts-2017-08-14?siteid=rss&rss=1","image_url":"http:\/\/s.marketwatch.com\/public\/resources\/MWimages\/MW-FS275_rain_MG_20170814132727.jpg","meta-llama-Llama-2-13b-hf_generated_text_wo_prompt":"underlying strength of corporate earnings.\nHowever, a closer look at corporate earnings reports tells a different tale of the companies that are holding the stock market\u2019s gains.\nThere are a few themes to emerge from the second-quarter earnings season. These include falling sales, increased borrowing and a surge in share buybacks to shore up earnings.\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, which put out a report Tuesday, revenues in the S&P 500 Index have fallen for three straight quarters, making it the worst quarter in terms of year-over-year declines since 2009. In total, sales fell 1.4 percent year-on-year and 3 percent when excluding the energy sector.\nGoldman Sachs also said that the S&P 500 companies that have announced earnings results over the past five weeks have generated more debt at a faster pace than in the last five years, and it warned that rising debt burdens are leading to reduced investment in the overall economy.\nThe increase in debt raises questions about how much longer corporates can keep on borrowing to shore up earnings.\nThere is also growing evidence that companies have turned to share buybacks to prop up earnings. According to Goldman Sachs, buybacks now account for 100 percent of the S&P 500\u2019s aggregate earnings, \u201cup from 58 percent in 2013, and 73 percent in 2016.\u201d\nWall Street has long argued that share repurchases boost economic growth and corporate profits while reducing inflationary pressures.\nThe latest data, however, has sparked concern from economists, who say that rising stock prices caused by buybacks and dividend payouts are masking underlying economic problems.\nOne of the chief issues with Wall Street\u2019s current equity valuations is the fact that many large-cap stocks are trading at lofty price-to-earnings ratios. Investors generally argue that stocks that have P\/E ratios lower than 15x are good value, while those that trade at prices above 25x are overvalued.

Opportunities like these don\u2019t come without the support and encouragement from my family, Coach Cal, the coaching staff, my teammates, and of course, the fans.\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed every moment of this journey at the University of Kentucky and I just want to thank everyone for who has supported me through both my ups and my downs. Lord knows this hasn\u2019t been easy, but my time here has only better prepared me for what the future has for me.\n\u201cAfter receiving positive feedback, my dreams of becoming a professional basketball player are that much closer to reality.

He shot 39.6 percent (42-for-106) from 3-point range and led the Wildcats with 40 blocked shots.\nIt's NBA draft decision day: Will these UK players return next season?\nYou may like: John Calipari talking to NBA teams about UK players testing out draft\nAlso: PJ Washington withdraws from NBA draft and will return to Kentucky\nThe highlight of Gabriel's season came in the SEC Tournament semifinals when he hit all 7 of his 3-point attempts en route to a team-high 23 points in a win over Alabama.\n\"Wenyen\u2019s game is where the league continues to trend towards,\u201d UK head coach John Calipari said in a news release confirming the decision. \u201cHe\u2019s a position-less big man who can shoot, guard multiple positions and is willing to do what it takes to win. Wenyen grew so much from his freshman season to his sophomore year. If he continues to make those same strides, he\u2019s going to carve himself a role with a team. He and I have talked and he knows he\u2019s going to have to work hard to get there, but I\u2019m confident he can.\u201d\nSince the end of the season, UK has lost Kevin Knox, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Hamidou Diallo to the draft and Sacha Killeya-Jones and Tai Wynyard to transfers.\nFreshman forward PJ Washington announced he was returning to UK earlier Wednesday, and multiple national reports suggested the Wildcats could add Stanford graduate transfer Reid Travis to next season's roster.\nBoth Washington and Travis play Gabriel's position. UK also will feature 2017-18 starter Nick Richards and five-star recruit EJ Montgomery in the post positions, clogging the path to the number of minutes Gabriel might have needed to improve his stock.\nAt the combine earlier this month, Calipari said he had talked with multiple teams that had worked out Gabriel.\n\"One team told me yes, the other team told me no,\" Calipari said. \"But the good news about this league: You only have to have one team that likes you. The other 29 can say you stink, but if that one likes you, they take you.\"\nGabriel seems likely to start his professional career overseas or in the NBA's developmental league.\nTravis will be a fifth-year senior next season. His addition would ensure Kentucky does not play a second consecutive season without a scholarship junior or senior, but for now Washington, Richards and point guard Quade Green, each entering their second season at Kentucky, are the most experienced scholarship players on the roster.\nJon Hale: jahale@courier-journal.com; Twitter: @JonHale_CJ.

Assuming that doesn\u2019t happen, I suppose all of us fans of the Pittsburgh Steelers should probably be pulling for the Eagles to upset the Patriots.\nI plan on sitting back on Sunday and eating 50 wings ahead of the Super Bowl getting underway.\nWe\u2019ll have a game thread going on Sunday as well and invite all of you to participate in it. I might even run a contest ahead of time.\nEnough chit chat, below are your Friday night five questions and I hope several of you have time to answer each one of them along with the two bonus questions in the comment section below.\nPeace and love, peace and love! Have a safe Super Bowl weekend.\nGo Eagles!\n1 \u2013 Name one team from the AFC and NFC that did not make the playoffs this season that will do so next season. Also, name one team from the AFC and NFC that made the playoffs this season that won\u2019t make it next season.\n2 \u2013 Where will quarterback Kirk Cousins be playing in 2018?\n3 \u2013 Over\/under 22.5 total completions for Eagles quarterback Nick Foles in Super Bowl LII?\n4 \u2013 The result of the Super Bowl LII coin-flip will be heads or tails?\n5 \u2013 Over\/under 74.5 receiving yards for Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski in Super Bowl LII?\nBonus #1 \u2013 For 8 points, without going over the actual number, what will the combined total be of points scored plus explosive plays of 20 yards or longer plus total turnovers?\nBonus #2 \u2013 Will former Steelers guard Alan Faneca be voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame Saturday night?\nRecap of Senior Bowl Week Friday Night Questions:\nQuestion 1 \u2013 An optimistic response of 14 yes; believe that a long-term contract will be signed without having to tag Le\u2019Veon Bell. Alan Tman even laid out the terms: $45 million over 3 years with $28 million guaranteed over 2 years. It would be spread this way: 18-15-12. The 11 naysayers don\u2019t see the Steelers offering more than last year nor Bell taking an offer he has already turned down. Stay tuned.\nQuestion 2 \u2013 Alabama LB Rashaan Evans is the Senior Bowl player that we would most like to see in a Steelers uniform. He got 5 votes. Next with 3 votes is Oklahoma LB Ogbonnia Okoronkwo. Six players got 2 votes each: Texas A & M Safety Armani Watts; UCF LB Shaquem Griffin; Hawaii Safety Trayvon Henderson; Colorado State WR Michael Gallup; USC LB Uchenna Nwoso; & San Diego State RB Rashaad Penny. Texas DT Poona Ford & Oklahoma QB Baker Mayfield each got one mention. Dave Bryan\u2019s version 1.0 mock draft and Alex Kozora\u2019s Senior Bowl mock draft both mention at least one of your senior bowl favorites.\nQuestion 3 \u2013 Although 18 indicated that they would watch XFL compared to 7 who said no \u2013 the support was rather soft when looking at the comments such as Mike Manzo\u2019s, \u201cOnly if I\u2019m walking past the tv and it\u2019s on.\u201d\nQuestion 4 \u2013 The first question worth points this week. With the Killer B\u2019s playing we thought that Ben, Brown & Bell would rack up some fantasy points. Our median response was 23 points scored with all that talent out there. A killer B did score some fantasy points, but it was Chris Boswell who saved the Steelers from being goose egged. Darth Blount 47 low balled his prediction and pegged it at 6 points. The next closest was a couple people with 14. Well done!\nQuestion 5 \u2013 The killer B\u2019s did contribute to the longest touchdown in this year\u2019s Pro Bowl. Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s pick-6 pass was returned for 79 yards and Wes Lee pegged that for 10 points. Well done!\nThis week is the last opportunity to unseat Alan Tman who has been in first place since Week 8! This is a big weekend for the NFL since the latest class of the Hall of Fame will be announced along with the MVP and offensive & defensive players of the year will be announced.

Some economists suspect that Chinese firms have been front-loading shipments due to the Sino-U.S. trade frictions.\nOn the whole, however, economists were sceptical of the sustainability of industrial sector strength, suggesting the broader economy will face pressure over coming months.\n\"We doubt this strength will be sustained for long given that it appears to mostly reflect a temporary boost to industrial output from the easing of pollution controls rather than a turnaround in underlying demand,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, in a note after the data release.\nNomura analysts were also of the view the strong PMI readings will be short-lived, saying \"the growth of end-demand, such as infrastructure and property investment, has slumped in recent months, due at least in part to the government\u00b4s deleveraging efforts.\"\nSMALL FIRMS FACE FUNDING PRESSURES\nBeijing has been tightening controls on riskier investments, the shadow banking business and speculation in the property sector, but has been keen to keep the broad economy well funded.\nThe industrial sector, a key source of jobs, remained in healthy shape, with profits growing at their fastest pace in six months, underpinned by continued strength in the steel sector.\nBut the latest survey showed that more manufacturers were concerned about tightening in funding over recent months, with 40.1 percent of all firms polled raising the issue in May, according to Zhao Qinghe, an official with the statistics bureau.\n\"Big cost pressure is still one of the major problems facing Chinese manufacturers these days,\" said Zhao.\nActivity of small firms contracted in May after expanding the previous month while both big and medium-sized companies all posted positive growth.\nHi-tech manufacturing activity rose to 54.8 in May, up from April's 53.8, despite pending U.S. tariff list under its intellectual property probe and restrictions on Chinese investments in the U.S.\nWashington said on Tuesday that it was moving forward with its threat to apply tariffs on Chinese imports worth up to $50 billion, reviving fresh worries of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Trade tensions had ebbed only recently after Beijing pledged to buy more from the United States.\nChina's economy grew at a slightly faster-than-expected pace of 6.8 percent in the first quarter. However, signs of stress were evident with investment growth slowing to a near 20-year low in April and growth in retail sales sliding.\nBoosted by government infrastructure spending, a resilient housing market and unexpected strength in exports, China's manufacturers helped the economy deliver strong growth last year.\nEconomists still expect China's economic growth to slow to 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017, citing rising borrowing costs, tougher limits on industrial pollution and a crackdown on local governments' spending to keep their debt levels in check.\nA sister survey showed growth in China's service sector also picked up pace in May, with the official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edging up to 54.9 from 54.8 the previous month.\nA sub-reading for construction activity, a major driver of growth in 2017, stood at 60.1 in May, down from 60.6 in April.\nChinese policymakers are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports. The services sector now accounts for over half of the economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending clout.\nA composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services activity rose to 54.6 in May, from April's 54.1.\n(Reporting by Stella Qiu and Ryan Woo Editing by Shri Navaratnam)","domain":"www.dailymail.co.uk","date":"2018-05-31 04:09:04","description":"BEIJING, May 31 (Reuters) - China's vast manufacturing sector grew at the fastest pace in eight months in May, blowing past expectations and easing...","url":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/wires\/reuters\/article-5789567\/China-May-factory-growth-8-mth-high-tight-funding-hits-smaller-firms.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490","image_url":"http:\/\/i.dailymail.co.uk\/i\/pix\/m_logo_636x382px.png","meta-llama-Llama-2-13b-hf_generated_text_wo_prompt":"as trade tensions with the United States simmer.\nThe official purchasing managers' index (PMI) was the highest since September 2017, the data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed.\nA separate PMI from private sector research firm Caixin\/Markit was due later on Thursday, with a reading of 50 expected after the flash PMI of 50.2 last month.\nThe solid official PMI could also put pressure on the central bank to not cut borrowing costs too soon to support the slowing economy, as that may make it difficult to continue controlling asset bubbles in the financial sector, analysts said.\n\"I think it will make the PBOC (People's Bank of China) and policymakers a bit more cautious with regards to monetary easing. It will make them hesitant to do more stimulus,\" said Hao Zhou, emerging market economist at Commerzbank.\nAnalysts were already saying China's economy was showing signs of stabilising after a rough patch, with industrial output and investment both outperforming expectations in April and setting up for a strong second quarter.\nChina's economy grew 6.4 percent year-on-year in January-March, slightly above market expectations and the weakest in a decade but the trade war is seen as only one of the risks as the world's second-biggest economy struggles to transition towards new growth drivers.\nA slew of stimulus measures unveiled by China in late 2016 and early 2017, including some US$450 billion in infrastructure spending, has helped to revive the economy but it faces more headwinds in 2019 from slower domestic demand and faltering exports, even as growth stabilises.\nThe official manufacturing PMI was the highest since September 2017, coming in at 50.8, above the 50.5 mark forecast in a Reuters poll and the 50.5 reading in April.

Barry Jackson is on the extreme left.\nThe other week, former Hanging Heaton milkman, Ronnie Ellis, delighted readers with his memories of the days when he and his dad had a milk round in Batley Carr.\nHe mentioned the many pubs which once existed there and also the shops and mills, which got a response from other readers eager to share their memories of Batley Carr.\nPeter Gibbard last week wrote about the bomb which blew up his house in Old Bank Road, Dewsbury, during the Second World War.\nOthers have since written about another bomb which fell in Wakefield Road, killing a man working at Ridings Pit.\nThere was also another bomb dropped in Savile Town round about the same time which resulted in other fatalities.\nIt seemed enemy planes were trying to blow up the railway goods yard which once stood on land where stores like Sainsbury\u2019s now stand.\nHopefully, I will be able to research more details of these tragedies and include them in forthcoming articles, all thanks to readers coming forward with their memories..\nThis week I received an email from Tony Hudson, a former Wheelwright Grammar School boy, who now lives in South Africa.\nHe remembers the rich culture which once existed in Dewsbury, and sends this delightful picture of a group of \u201cLikely Lads\u201d enjoying a night out at Batley Jazz Club.\nTony contacted me after reading Ronnie Ellis\u2019s memories of Batley Carr which made him remember all the times he walked through this village on his way to his father\u2019s place of work \u2013 A.N Cook \u2013 in Bradford Road.\nTony was born in Staincliffe in 1936 and moved to Mirfield when he was four years old, later attending Wheelwright Grammar School.\nHe did, however, have a strong connection with Batley Carr where his father, Eric Hudson, was a partner in the textile company of A.N Cook.\nMany people who walked on Bradford Road in those days will also remember the firm.\nI certainly do because I was always entranced by the lovely leaded window on which was inscribed the name A.N. Cook.\nHow many times did I wonder what these initials stood for, and now I know, thanks to Tony. They were the initials of his godfather, Arthur Norman Cook.\nTony writes: \u201cIt was with a certain degree of nostalgia that I read Margaret Watson\u2019s article about Ronnie Ellis\u2019s memories of Batley Carr.\n\u201cMy schooling commenced at Dewsbury Wheelwright Grammar School in the kindergarten class which was situated in the girl\u2019s grammar school. This later moved down the road to the boy\u2019s school in Birkdale Road.\n\u201cIt was from here that after school I used to cross over Halifax Road and wend my way down to my dad\u2019s company in Batley Carr.\n\u201cAfter work, as a real treat, he would take me down to the Playhouse Cinema in Dewsbury where we had high tea in the cafe there.\n\u201cIt comprised mainly of beans on toast or egg and chips, a real treat at that time served by a waitress in the standard black dress and white apron.\n\u201cAfter tea dad would take me into the cinema to watch the likes of Betty Grable and Harry James or early Abbot and Costello films.\n\u201cI remember some of the places I used to visit as I would walk from Dewsbury along Bradford Road.\n\u201cThe first shop I came to was an \u201coutdoor living\u201d shop that sold tents of all shapes and sizes, primus stoves, knives, everything one would need to go camping.\n\u201cFrom this shop, for my birthday, I was bought a small ridge tent in which I spent many happy hours camping on our lawn.\n\u201cJust past this shop on the left side of the road was the company of S. Beaumont, another of our family friends.\n\u201cApart from the textile activity in Batley Carr, there was also the cycle shop of Bill Hargreaves who had an original Penny Farthing cycle outside his shop, and I always wondered if anyone knew how to ride it.\n\u201cAs I grew older our school modified our hours of attendance which meant we had Tuesday and Thursday afternoons free, but had to make this up by attending on Saturday morning.\n\u201cA crowd from our form used to go to the roller skating rink on a Tuesday afternoon. It was closed on Thursday afternoon for skating as it was being prepared for the evening function \u2013wrestling.\n\u201cStars at that time were Jack Pye, Hassan ali Bey, The Farmer and the Farmer\u2019s Boy.\n\u201cThis eventually came to an end when the building was sold and became the site for the Batley Variety Club.\n\u201cI remember while at school experiencing all kinds of music available locally from the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra to brass band concerts and loud dance band music as I passed the record department f J W Thornes at the bottom of Daisy Hill.\n\u201cBest of all was a live session listening to the Johnny Dankworth Seven with an 18 year old Cleo Laine.\n\u201cThis was above Burton\u2019s Tailors in Batley.

{"title":"Couples Who Eat A Lot Of Seafood Have More Sex & Get Pregnant Faster, Study Finds","text":"It turns out, the oyster aphrodisiac myth not be a myth at all. You may have heard that they'll get you in the mood because oysters are high in zinc, which is linked to high testosterone levels and in rats. I've also heard it's because eating an oyster is similar to giving oral sex to a woman, which I don't understand because I've definitely never done that in a Red Lobster. But as far as oysters leading to sex is concerned, there may be science to back this idea up.\nNew research from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which looked at data of 501 couples who were trying to get pregnant, shows that eating seafood is linked to having more sex \u2014 and higher pregnancy rates. They study went on for four years, where couples were each followed for one year or until pregnancy was detected. And the results were clear \u2014 more seafood intake was associated with having more sex and fecundity \u2014 which essentially just means fertility or the ability to produce offspring. Say it with me: fecundity. More seafood, higher fecundity.\nBasically, the research found that 92 percent of the couples who ate fish and shellfish at least twice a week were able to get pregnant within the year. They also found that those who ate the most fish and shellfish \u2014 to the tune of eight or more times a month \u2014 had a 22 percent higher rate of sexual activity than average. So if you're trying to get pregnant \u2014 or just have more sex life \u2014 you may want to pass the lobster.\nThe researchers actually didn't set out to prove the link between seafood and sexual intercourse, so the results were a shock to them too. \"We are not sure what exactly is driving this association,\" Audrey J. Gaskins, Sc.D., Research Associate at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, tells Bustle. \"For example, the original reason why shellfish such as oysters were linked to increased libido was due to their high zinc content. Studies have shown that in humans, dietary zinc intake has a positive correlation with testosterone levels and in rats that zinc therapy improves sexual competence. However, given that we did not measure zinc intake in our study and zinc is found in many other foods other than seafood, we felt uncomfortable making this link in our study.\"\nGaskin also says there's a possible behavioral explanation for the link. \"It is also possible that couples who consume higher amounts of seafood together share more meals and thus more time together (including nights) which may be a behavioral explanation for the association we observed with sexual activity,\" she says.\nSo now you know. But that's not the first time a link between food and sex has been proven. Take a look at some of the connections below.\n1 Millennials Like Food As Much As Sex Andrew Zaeh for Bustle In 2016, a survey from Havas Worldwide and Market Probe International, of almost 12,000 adults of all ages, found that 54 percent of millennials believed that food is on the same level as sex. Millennials are far more likely to put food that high on the list than other generations \u2014 as only 42 percent of Baby Boomers said the same.\n2 Guacamole Can Help You Hook Up Andrew Zaeh for Bustle Whether you're looking for love or sex, certain foods can help you get there. Zoosk, the dating platform, looked at 3,733,185 dating profiles and 364,609,566 first messages and found that food was often associated with a higher response rate. For example, mentioning guacamole in a message got you 114 percent more replies than not mentioning it. It really is the way to our hearts \u2014 and our everything else.\n3 An Apple A Day Can Help Your Roll In The Hay Andrew Zaeh for Bustle This is one reason to get your five-a-day. Research published in the journal of Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics found that apples can actually stimulate sexual arousal in women. The research found that apples can improve lubrication and overall sexual function. Just something to keep in mind the next time you're at the grocery store.\n4 Men And Women Think About Sex More Than Food Andrew Zaeh for Bustle A 2011 study from psychologists at Ohio University found that women think about sex about once every 50 minutes, compared to men who think about it every 28 minutes. When it comes to food, women think about it every 62 minutes \u2014 while men tended to think about it every 38 minutes. So let me get this straight: Some women think about food less than once an hour? The average woman does? I have never met any of these women. I want to take my own poll about how many seconds pass between me thinking about bread. If I can get the number up to 20, I win.","domain":"www.bustle.com","date":"2018-05-30 15:33:35","description":"It turns out, the oyster aphrodisiac myth not be a myth at all.

We found some at The Raw Kitchen and in the wild at Greenpoint Fish & Lobster in Brooklyn.

Picture taken February 10, 2016. REUTERS\/Olivia Harris\nSINGAPORE Malaysia's Petronas has pitched an estimated $1 billion stake in a prized upstream local gas project to potential bidders including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N), Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP.BK) and Japanese firms, sources familiar with the matter said.\nIf successful, the deal could mark Petronas' biggest upstream stake sale since oil prices started declining more than two years ago. Petronas is targeting lowering operating expenses, job cuts and project rollbacks to help it navigate through the low oil price environment.\nCiting sources, Reuters reported in February that Petronas was considering selling a stake of as much as 49 percent in the SK316 offshore gas block in Malaysia's Sarawak state.\nThe state-owned oil and gas company has approached about a dozen prospective buyers including global oil majors and Asian firms focussed on Southeast Asia, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the talks are private.\nThey said Petronas has begun providing financial and operational data to the companies and expects to receive bids over the next few weeks.\n\"It's just what the environment is. Nobody wants to keep all the risk on their books,\" said Vikas Halan, senior credit officer, corporate finance group at Moody's, adding he viewed the move as a rebalancing of Petronas' portfolio.\n\"Petronas is the leader in the oil and gas space, especially on the gas side. The experience of getting or producing LNG and marketing LNG is quite an interesting one and Petronas becomes a logical choice for players,\" he said.\nIn a statement to Reuters, Petronas said that through its subsidiary, Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, it is looking for partners who can bring the technology and capabilities to explore, develop and efficiently operate the various fields and opportunities in the SK316 offshore gas block.\n\"We are confident that we will attract the right partners to maximise the potential value of these opportunities to help meet the world's growing oil and gas demand,\" Petronas said.\nIt was not immediately known what the individual companies' response to Petronas' approach was.\nOne financial source said a minority stake might not appeal to non-Asian oil majors but a decision to bid would depend on details of the stake being offered, valuations and the potential for long term partnerships with Petronas.\nExxonMobil declined to comment, while Shell referred the query to Petronas. A spokeswoman for PTTEP declined to comment on the deal but said the company was keen to invest in Southeast Asia because it had expertise in the region where costs and risks were low.\nGas from the NC3 field in the SK316 block feeds Malaysia's LNG export project, known as LNG 9, Petronas' joint venture with JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp (5020.T) that began commercial production in January.\nPetronas could use the funds from the stake sale to develop the Kasawari field in the same block. The field is one of the largest non-associated gas fields in Malaysia and has an estimated recoverable hydrocarbon resource of about three trillion standard cubic feet.\n\"Kasawari will require a significant capital investment to develop due to the high CO2 content,\" said Prasanth Kakaraparthi, senior upstream research analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.\n\"In a lower-for-longer oil price world, it makes commercial sense for Petronas to farm down its interest and partner with companies that have innovative CO2 handling technology,\" he said.\nPetronas put on hold plans to develop the field in 2015 after oil and gas prices fell, according to media reports.\n(Reporting by Anshuman Daga and Gloystein Henning in SINGAPORE; Additional reporting by A.

{"title":"A Million Acres Scorched by Montana Wildfires","text":"Dry conditions plagued Montana this summer, with multiple wildfires torching over 1 million acres throughout the state. The largest fire, the Lodgepole Complex fire, impacted over 270,000 acres. Recent rain and snow, and the forecast for continued precipitation, help to suppress the fires and provide welcome relief for Montana residents.\nFires aren't too uncommon in Montana, but this year's fire season has been different. Spring brought plenty of moisture from an abundant snow-pack and provided adequate moisture for grass growth. The moisture quickly depleting leaving most of the state in drought condition.\n\"Ranchers saw this as great grass and feed. Firefighters saw it as fuel,\" said Dennis Garcia, Farm Service Agency (FSA) county executive director for Glacier County, Montana. Garcia was activated to serve in the National Guard during the wildfire suppression efforts near Lolo, Montana.\nFSA provides assistance to farmers and ranchers who have been impacted by natural disasters, including wildfires, by administering a suite of safety-net programs to help producers recover from eligible losses, such as the Livestock Indemnity Program, the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program, and the Tree Assistance Program. The programs can assist farmers and ranchers who lost livestock, grazing land, fences or eligible trees, bushes and vines as a result of the qualifying natural disaster.\nThe Lolo Peak Fire, southwest of Lolo, Montana, has impacted over 53,000 acres. The National Guard was activated to help with evacuation efforts near the wildfire.\nIn addition, the FSA Emergency Conservation Program provides funding and technical assistance for farmers and ranchers to rehabilitate farmland damaged by natural disasters. Low-interest emergency loans are available to help producers recover from production and physical losses. Compensation is also available to producers who purchased coverage through the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, which protects non-insurable crops (including native grass for grazing) against natural disasters that result in lower yields, crop losses or prevented planting.\nRecommended Stories For You\nAs a result of the ongoing drought conditions, all Montana counties were approved for emergency haying and grazing of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres. Due to drought and fire conditions, 53 of the state's 56 counties have been declared either primary or contiguous disaster areas.\n\"The short term impact is FSA can do a lot of good for producers. Producers can get some relief, fix fences and get feed purchased,\" Garcia said.\nGarcia said hay donations came into the state from other areas to help out ranchers in need. Additionally, FSA employees from other states, including Missouri and Oklahoma, have spent time helping Montana producers enroll in FSA disaster programs.\n\"It is proof that the agriculture community is one big small town where you have a lot of folks that have camaraderie,\" he said.\nDetailed information on all of these disaster assistance programs can be found online at: http:\/\/www.fsa.usda.gov\/disaster.

Courtesy of www.inciweb.gov\nAfter the fire, many ranches and communities throughout Montana are in the midst of cleanup, recovery, and preparation efforts as winter approaches. Some efforts being made include the removal of fence lines, rebuilds of water catchments and troughs, repairing pastures and water crossings, and removing trees and brush burned by the fire. One ranch, the Blackburn Ranches, was particularly impacted and is seeking to recover and thrive following the loss of many structures and livestock that burned in the fire.\nBlackburn Ranches in Musselshell, Montana, in the wake of the fire\nThe Blackburn Ranches lost 40% of their grazing acreage due to the fire, and many fence lines were compromised in the process. This loss of land resulted in the ranch having to implement an alternative feeding strategy to get their cows ready for the winter, as grass was no longer available in the area. The ranch relied on a mobile grazing strategy, which is an approach that moves cows on a regular basis to use the remaining vegetation and improve the remaining grazing land. However, moving a large herd of cows can be a challenge, as it requires a large number of vehicles and people to help gather the cows, and the cows must be contained to avoid losing any.\nThe Blackburn Ranches relied on their neighbors and ranching community to assist with the herding efforts, and ranchers from around the area came to help. Many of the ranchers in the area were affected by the fire, but still came to help as they are part of a tight-knit community.\nOne herd of cows is contained while waiting to be moved.\nOver the course of a few days, the cows were moved to a new location to graze on grass, helping prepare them for the winter months ahead.
