PAOLI, IN (WAVE) - Like many American towns, Paoli has evolved with the times.
The changing of the decades show in the decrepit drive-in movie theater. Something that you now just drive by.
However, there's one thing in Paoli that hasn't changed one bit. A full service gas station stands right next to the downtown roundabout.
""We pump the gas for you, wash your windshields, and they get pretty happy about that,"" Daniel McCabe said.

McCabe is a newbie at Riley Oil Company. He said he started back in August after he lost his other job. He also said it was pretty cool knowing that he is one of the few who hold the position of gas pump assistant.
Customers who come by said it's a treat from the past.
""You don't necessarily want to get out and pump your own gas and here you can stay in your car and just do it that way,"" Loretta Brown said.
McCabe said he especially enjoys the small talk, getting to know residents of Paoli. Owners Jo Ann and Jeff Riley said that's their favorite part too.
""You get out there and you talk to so many people,"" Jo Ann Riley said. ""Everybody has a story and every story is different.""
Riley said the royal treatment has been around for decades.
""It started in 1971,"" Riley said. ""Glendon Riley, which is my husband's father -- he opened it.""
Since then, not once did the business stray from the most important thing: family. It's a Riley empire, honestly.
""Me, Troy, Eric, dad, Jodie, Jackie, so we have six?"" Jeff Riley said, counting the family members on his fingers. ""Six Riley's that work here.""
Jo Ann explained the family continues to grow.

""There are already great-grandbabies being born so I imagine it will be in the family for a long time,"" Jo Ann said. She added that the service they provide is a dedication to their customers.
""A lot of places will say they'll pump it for a penny more,"" Jo Ann said. ""We're not going to charge you a penny more.""
The miles have meaning alright. At Riley's a gallon takes you through generations.
""It's just family everywhere, you know it's just family,"" Riley said. ""We just, I think we have gas running through our veins instead of blood sometimes.""

"She's openly shared pictures of the stretch marks covering her thighs, and now Chrissy Teigen is lifting the lid on stretch marks during pregnancy and what she does to avoid them.
The 32-year-old who is mom to two-year-old Luna is due to give birth to her second child, a son, in June.
And speaking to Refinery29, the searingly honest author and model explained that as she's from 'a real stretch mark-prone family', she's had stretch marks for years.
Honest: Model and author Chrissy Teigen, 32, has opened up about the products she uses during pregnancy to avoid stretch marks
Go-tos: Chrissy's routine includes Aquaphor, $4.99, Lumière Concentrate, $85.95, and coconut oil
Lucky: Mom to two-year-old Luna and due to give birth to her second child, a son, in June, Chrissy admitted to Refinery29 that her belly is the one place she doesn't get marks
'I had stretch marks way before the baby. Mine went to my inner thighs for some reason — my thighs just got really angry one year.'
Referencing an Instagram post from August 2015 where her stretch marks on her thighs could clearly be seen, she added that she didn't post her 'stretchies for the praise'.
'I post[ed] it because [of] the wine also I like the pattern and they're so soft.'
However that doesn't mean she's complacent when it comes to preventing them on her belly during pregnancy and shared that for her, it's all about prevention.
'Sometimes, we only take care of our skin when we see a breakout happening, but with stretch marks, it's all about prevention,' she said.
And she's a big fan of getting the whole family involved: 'I'm big now, so it's hard for me to bend over. John helps me a lot with everything at the end of the night. Luna loves helping out.
'It's exhausting to do this 10-15 minute session of lubing up your belly and body, with all these different layers, especially when you're like, ""I don't even have a stretch mark yet!""'
Admitting that as she has naturally dry skin, Chrissy uses a combination of products to keep her skin soft, smooth and stretch mark free, and uses budget drugstore brand Aquaphor on her elbows, along with coconut oil all over her body.
Prep: However, she spends 10-15 minutes per night applying products to her belly to prevent any scarring and says prepping the skin before any stretching occurs is key
Family affair: Chrissy also shared that she gets her husband John Legend and daughter Luna also help out every night
Stretchies say hi: Chrissy has been open about her battle with stretch marks in the past and posted this candid shot of her stretch mark covered thighs in April 2015
However, her favorite products come from high-end skincare brand Lumière de Vie because - as she candidly confessed during the interview - she gets it for free.
'Honestly, a lot of it comes from Lumière because I worked with them and they send it to me,' she explained.
'That's one of the only beauty campaigns I did where it was like, I would do this for products. I don't need money, I don't need anything — Lumière is just such an incredible product.'
She uses the brand's concentration on her belly, 'especially around the sides because you never know where stretch marks are going to pop up.'
'The only place I don't have stretch marks on my body is my belly. The other places that have them are from regular wear and tear of my body,' she added.
However, Chrissy also shared that she's never seen a woman without stretch marks, and detailed how every model she's worked with has had at least one.
'I've worked with every supermodel in the world. I'm lucky to know that the most incredibly beautiful women all have stretch marks and all have the butt dimples. It really is our common bond.'",1.0539215803146362,0,1
"-year-old model is currently expecting her second child with singer and her husband John Legend.
On Saturday she took to Twitter to ask her followers if they knew of a preventative measure to avoid stretch marks.
""I remember my first pregnancy, I had absolutely no stretch marks, and am wondering if it’s the same for the 2nd...have you had good luck so far?"" Teigen asked.
""Please tell me it’s genetics because my mom has none and never had it on her bump, alllll over her boobs but nothing else. What have you used? I have oils, oils and more oils.""
Teigen's leg tattoo was revealed while she was pregnant with her daughter Luna.
Teigen told BuzzFeed she'd always had trouble sleeping on her back and asked for permission to lie on her left side in the delivery room to try and avoid stretch marks.
Learning her request would be too hard to enforce for medical staff, Teigen decided to just have the words ""no stretch marks"" tattooed on her thigh instead.
Teigen told Glamour magazine this week it was still too early to tell whether she would be lucky enough to dodge stretch marks the second time around.
Chrissy Teigen is a mother to daughter Luna and is currently pregnant with her second child.
Despite having stretch marks on her bump for her first pregnancy, the model isn't deterred by them, and is confident they're a sign of a healthy pregnancy and happy baby.
""It’s a privilege that my body is doing the thing it’s supposed to do,"" she told People.
""I feel very fortunate to be pregnant at all, so it’s a trade-off. I don’t mind getting a little stretch marks. You have to take it with a grain of salt.""
When she isn't on Twitter telling us her life story, Chrissy Teigen is working as a model.
Teigen credits her ""stretchie"" mummy-friends with helping her see the positives of her body, too, which helps combat any negative feelings she may have about her stretch marks.

"OCEANSIDE — Lifeguard David Wilson was honored this week for a heroic water rescue that saved a life.
The rescue occurred July 17, 2016. Wilson was on unit patrol at Harbor Beach tower 14 along with veteran lifeguard Mike Wagner.
“It was a pretty busy day,” Wilson said.
He began his day instructing students in the Junior Lifeguard Program. He then continued to put in patrol hours due to sizable summer crowds and rough seas.
Earlier that afternoon he was part of several land and sea rescues, including getting a child out of a locked sweltering car.
Then came a distress call about a solo jet skier crashed on the jetty at the mouth of the harbor. The location of the accident is nicknamed the “devil’s triangle” due to the dangers the rock jetty poses.
Wilson responded and found the man thrown off the jet ski, semiconscious, wedged between two boulders and unable to free himself. He attempted to free the man as consistent sets of pounding waves hit him and the victim.
While Wilson aided the victim a city harbor officer pulled up in a patrol boat and lent a hand in the difficult rescue. The two were able to put a lifejacket under the victim’s head as a buoy.
To set the man free, Wilson needed to dive underwater and release the victim’s legs. Eventually the pair dislodged the man, but not without getting knocked down by waves and enduring some major scrapes from the surrounding rocks, which Wilson described as a cheese grater.
“It seemed forever, we got beat up pretty well, yelling ‘brace’ between waves,” Wilson said.
A city firefighter arrived and the three pulled the victim from the rocks between sets of waves, up onto a stretcher and to an awaiting air ambulance. Due to HIPPA privacy laws the name of the victim has not been released.
“No doubt that without his iron effort, knowledge and skill in the ocean environment, a life would have been lost,” Capt. Bill Curtis, Oceanside Fire Department Lifeguard Division, said.
“David knowingly placed himself in harm’s way with one goal and an incredible outcome.”
For most the work day would end there, but Wilson showered off his cut leg and returned to duty to help with an issued code five alert. That afternoon he pulled 20 people from the harbor’s choppy waters.
“It’s one of the crazier situations I’ve been in,” Wilson said.
Code five rescue operations involved every lifeguard on duty. Wilson said to aid multiple people in distress his partner paddled out on a rescue board, directed a group of five people to hold on and Wilson swam two of them at a time into shore.
“It was a good day with a positive outcome,” Wilson said.
Despite his long day and injuries Wilson was at the Junior Lifeguard Program the following morning instructing potential future guards.
The recognition ceremony for his heroism took place in Sacramento on Sept. 25. Out of 21 applicants Wilson was the only one to receive the prestigious Governor’s Public Safety Medal of Valor this year.
Wilson grew up in Oceanside and has served as a city lifeguard since 2012. He just completed criminal justice studies and plans to pursue a career as a State Beach peace officer ranger/lifeguard.
He said his career path was inspired by fellow Oceanside lifeguards whose rescues have become legend.
“There aren’t a lot of people in this profession who get recognized for their amazing feats,” Wilson said. “I’m beyond blessed being able to do this.”
Last year Oceanside beaches saw more than 4 million visitors. Lifeguards prevented more than 82,000 accidents and performed in excess of 3,000 water rescues.",1.1350232362747192,0,1
"at Oceanside’s Harbor Beach when he witnessed a woman fall off her inflatable raft as a wave crashed over her.
He immediately jumped into action, grabbing the raft’s rope and pulling the raft and unconscious woman toward shore.
He jumped onto a nearby jetty to continue pulling the raft. At this point, the raft’s rope became tangled in a piling and Wilson was pulled off the jetty into the water. As he was being dragged into the ocean, he grabbed the rope from the piling and jumped back onto the jetty. As he and his fellow lifeguards were pulling the raft back to the beach, another lifeguard noticed that the woman was still unconscious. Wilson dove into the water, swimming 30 yards to get to the woman, and bringing her onto the raft. He and other lifeguards then continued to pull the raft back to shore, where the woman was placed in the care of medical personnel and transported to the hospital.
Wilson was recognized for his efforts at a ceremony on Monday at Mission San Luis Rey Parish. At the ceremony, the Harbor Beach Association presented Wilson with a check for $5,000 to pay for any medical bills from the incident.
A plaque was presented to Wilson, reading, “Harbor Beach Association acknowledges your exemplary life-saving actions and your willingness to place your life on the line to rescue your fellow citizens.”
Oceanside City Councilman Jack Feller, a former Oceanside City Fire Department captain, also spoke during the ceremony, saying he felt privileged to have been a part of the program. He described how he felt at the time.
“When something like this happens, there’s a great sense of pride, there’s a great sense of accomplishment that you had the wherewithal to be able to put your heart and mind into doing this,” Feller said.
Oceanside Fire Department Deputy Chief David Keever also presented a plaque to Wilson during the ceremony.
A San Clemente resident, Wilson works as a lifeguard at Oceanside Harbor Beach as well as at Camp Pendleton.

"The Great Southern Storm have named an initial colts squad of 45 players under a new coach as they prepare for the Great Southern Colts Carnival in Kulin next month.
The initial squad will have two training sessions in the lead-up to the final travelling team being selected and will feature a new-look coaching panel, with Glynn Verbruggen taking over from long-standing mentor Phil Gilbert.
Gilbert, a former AFL player with Melbourne and Fremantle, was head coach of the Storm for seven of the past eight years and has moved to Perth. Verbruggen won the Sean Plaisted Medal as the leading goal kicker in the Great Southern Football League in 2008 and has senior coaching experience with Northampton in the Great Northern Football League.
Recently Verbruggen has been in charge of the Claremont 15s development squad and was excited by the challenge of being announced as the Storm’s head figure.
“I’m really excited to take over as the senior Storm coach,” he said.
“I’ve stayed away from coaching senior football down here for this chance and the aim was to take over from Phil when he left.
“The opportunity has come up and I’m really keen to get in and help with the talented kids from the region.”
A strong squad has been named this week featuring a host of young players who are regulars at league level, while State 16 squad members Heath Spinks and Jacob Blight have also been included.
Squad members Fraser Eaton, Bryce Blaszkow, Tom Wolfe, Taj Williams, Lachy O’Shea, Ted Batchelor, Hayden Parker and Aidin Williss have already played State Country colts this season.
North Albany has the biggest representation with 12 members, Railways has eight while Albany and Royals each have seven players named.
“It will be good to get a look at all the talented kids over two sessions and over the next two rounds of local footy,” Verbruggen said.
“It’s a really even squad with a lot of younger age kids and we definitely will be very competitive at Kulin.”
The squad will train at Railways on June 4 and 11, from 5.30pm.

"Katanning on July 12 and 26 as they prepare for the carnival, which will see 14 teams compete from July 31 to August 3.
There is a new man at the helm of the GSS colts for the 2014 carnival as Luke Fenton replaces Paul Firth, who is taking a break.
Fenton coached the Great Southern District Under-16 team to the Division 1 title in 2011 and was an assistant coach for the 2013 Colts.
The GSS Colts were knocked out in the first round of the carnival last year, but are confident they can compete with a strong group of players for 2014.
The squad has an inexperienced look to it, with the older age group in the team largely coming from the Broomehill-Tambellup Football Club.
There are 25 players from BTFC and 14 Katanning players in the squad, which also includes Kukerin/Kojonup players.
Fenton said that he expected to have some more players drop out due to injury or unavailability closer to the carnival, but felt it was a good group and he was happy with the work ethic they were showing in training.
“We did quite a bit of training in the last few days and the majority of the boys were at all those sessions,” he said.
Fenton, who is a former Great Southern Football League league and colts player as well as a past player for East Fremantle, said that he would have to do plenty of work with the players with a number of them new to colts football.
“This is a completely new group of kids so it will be good working with a new group,” he said.
Fenton was pleased with the response the team had had at training, with around 40 per cent of them attending most sessions, which were mostly in the evening.
“The response has been good,” he said.
“The Katanning boys are really keen and there are some BT boys as well.
“I am very positive that things are going really well and that we will get a good bunch of boys.

"She seemed to let slip that she was expecting a baby boy during an appearance on RTE One's Cutting Edge earlier this month, before trying to cover it up.

"By partnering together to promote the adoption of cybersecurity best practices, the NTSC and CSA will aim to improve vendor security. Specifically, the two organizations will help standardize and improve cloud security vendor reviews by promoting and strengthening the CSA's Security, Trust & Assurance Registry (STAR) and related CSA tools as recommended practices for cloud security and vendor evaluations.
""We are excited to partner with the NTSC to make common cause toward raising the bar for cloud computing security and all new emerging technologies,"" said Jim Reavis, CEO of Cloud Security Alliance. ""CSA STAR is the world's largest cloud computing assurance program which, combined with NTSC's focus on CISO advocacy, will help accelerate trust of the cloud while preventing key stakeholders from reinventing the wheel.""
The NTSC and CSA are seeking to streamline the vendor security review process; reduce time, energy, and effort by encouraging best practices for vendors; and offer benefits to vendors who abide by this process and best practices. Together, the organizations will collaborate on a STAR-based questionnaire that maps to the most used compliance frameworks. A joint whitepaper will then provide information about this program, how CISOs can incorporate this program into their companies, and how vendors would incorporate the program when planning to work with organizations.
""The information security industry needs to evolve the way it assesses and improves cloud vendor security,"" said Patrick Gaul, Executive Director of the NTSC. ""CISOs don't have the same kind of transparency with third party cloud security vendors as they do with their own network systems. I'm excited that the preeminent CISO and cloud security auditing associations are partnering together, and we look forward to promoting a more rigorous way to help CISOs vet cloud security vendors based on CSA's successful STAR program.""
In addition to partnering on a cloud security vetting program, the CSA and the NTSC will also participate in each other's events, discuss industry issues in working groups, and collaborate on research involving cloud security. The NTSC encourages dialogue about cybersecurity issues, laws, and regulations through advocacy engagement with congressional members, regional CISO policy roundtables, and an annual DC Fly-In as part of its National CISO Policy Conference. The CSA holds many conferences, summits, events, and forums around the world to promote the use of best practices for providing security assurance within cloud computing.

In addition to the CAT-V program, the NTSC will be using CAIQ to drive awareness of its Security Awareness and Risk Management (SARM) program which includes the SARM Framework and SARM self-assessment tool. The NTSC, with the assistance of CSA, will use SARM to address vulnerabilities to sensitive transportation assets, facilities and information through risk-based security programs.
“With the increasing role that technology plays in our transportation sector, this partnership is one of vital importance to ensure that the technology used in our industry is secure and can be trusted,” said John McLeod, chairman of the NTSC. “By sharing best practices to foster collaboration, we can continue to make advancements that benefit the entire industry.”
The collaboration will leverage both organization’s expertise to identify and address gaps and misalignments in assessment practices to improve their quality and reduce the effort required for vendors. It will also include leveraging existing NTSC workforce and leadership development efforts and CSA industry resources including research reports, educational events and certification programs that promote industry best practices.
“Both organizations share similar philosophies around cybersecurity and how it is to be approached,” said Jim Hietala, vice president, security at The Open Group and CSA’s managing director. “The CSA is pleased to see the NTSC taking these proactive steps to help bring the transportation industry’s cybersecurity standards to the forefront.”

“Here lies America’s pastor,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, gesturing to Graham’s casket under the eye of the dome, surrounded by family, friends, lawmakers and a ring of paintings of the nation’s founders. “He ministered to all walks, from some of the greats whose statues line this hall_Eisenhower, King, Ford, and Reagan_to the everyday citizens lining up today to pay their respects.”
President Donald Trump said his father was an admirer of Graham’s and that the “legendary” American figure deserved to be recognized in the place “where the memory of the American people is enshrined.”
Graham’s influence stretched far beyond the city where he counseled lawmakers to a global flock over the better part of seven decades.
“The man we recognize today shared the Gospel with more people, face-to-face, than anyone else in history,” said Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
As the leaders stood by the casket, Trump reached out to touch the bare wood and Ryan bowed his head.
Graham died a week earlier at age 99. Some 30 family members are accompanying Graham’s casket to Washington, where he befriended presidents of both parties and counseled others over seven decades. Graham’s son, Franklin, tweeted a photo Wednesday of family members loading the casket onto a jet emblazoned with “Samaritan’s Purse,” the name of a Christian relief charity that he chairs.
Graham is lying in honor before a funeral Friday near his home in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Rotunda entrances were draped with black fabric, and Graham’s casket rested on a black-draped catafalque beneath the soaring ceiling and its painting, the “Apotheosis of Washington.”
Though he met every president since Harry Truman and counseled most, Graham grew wary of politics after Watergate. He was closest to Richard Nixon but later said he felt used by him.
Nonetheless, Graham ministered to other presidents until his health began to fail about 10 years ago.
Former President Bill Clinton recalled seeing one of Graham’s crusades as a child, a profound experience that became more amazing over his life. Graham counseled him as Arkansas governor, and later as president in the White House itself.
“In that little room, he was the same person I saw when I was 11 on that football field,” Clinton said Tuesday after viewing the casket at Graham’s home.
Former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, also visited Graham’s home on Tuesday.
In Washington, Ryan said there had been no doubt that Graham would receive the honor of a public viewing in the Rotunda. He told reporters that almost immediately upon hearing of Graham’s death he, Trump, McConnell and Rep. Patrick McHenry, who represents the Graham family’s district, agreed it would happen.
Graham shares the honor with 11 presidents and other distinguished Americans, starting with Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky in 1852 and, most recently, Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii in 2012, according to the House and the Architect of the Capitol.
Graham is only the fourth private person to lie in honor since 1998. The others are two U.S. Capitol Police officers who died in the line of duty in 1998 and civil rights hero Rosa Parks in 2005.
Trump met Graham at the pastor’s 95th birthday party in 2013, but is closer to Franklin Graham Jr.
On Friday, Trump was to attend Graham’s funeral near his library in Charlotte, North Carolina. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush will not be there, meaning no former presidents will attend the funeral.

"ing final respects to a man whose influence on American life was as towering as his famous lanky frame.
The honor granted Graham, a confidant to 12 presidents, was as impressive as any president bestows. Yet Graham insisted that he was no different than his fellow Americans — sinners saved by the grace of God, whose life work was to offer the same redemption to a needy world, said a son, Franklin Graham.
“He would want everyone to understand that he was simply a sinner, saved by the grace of God,” Franklin Graham told mourners in a private ceremony before the public arrived.
“There was no one like Billy Graham,” said former Vice President Joe Biden, a fellow Catholic. “He’s gone to his heavenly reward.”
From Graham’s pulpits in North Carolina, to Washington, to 60-day crusades in Los Angeles and New York City, millions heard his message of salvation and the power of Jesus Christ, and put their faith in him. He was a confidant to U.S. presidents going back to Harry Truman, through the years of Cold War confrontation and the culture wars of the past few decades.
Graham, who died at the age of 99 on Feb. 21 at his North Carolina mountain home, was honored with the rare distinction of lying in honor in the Rotunda, reserved for presidents, certain other government leaders and private citizens of extraordinary national significance.
Bill Clinton called Graham a “great American” and “true Christian.”
Hillary Clinton noted that she was the first children’s lawyer in the country to work with Graham in the 1980s, traveling on behalf of a children’s literacy program. She recalled how Graham, who once told her that “every home should have a Bible,” suggested that she get her husband to read it.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., paid tribute as an ordinary member of Graham’s flock.
McConnell quoted from Graham’s signature hymn, the old spiritual “Just As I Am,” and marveled at his fellow Kentuckian’s grace.
“I doubt that anybody in human history was as widely known as the reverend Billy Graham,” McConnell said.

Bible verses may provide words of wisdom in trying times, but do they really fulfill you the way chicken nuggets do?",1.0615153312683105,0,1
"oms. Her list included:
But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.—Matthew 19:14
Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.—Proverbs 22:6
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.—Ephesians 4:29
@brianab1188 was inspired to create the list after an unfortunate incident at an all-you-can-eat buffet.
She began by tweeting that her 2-year-old son ate a foul stomach-turning food.
My 2 year old just ate a tater tots that had a fried frog eye in it. Im so upset. He's fine but I'm a mess. I took him out for a special Mom & Son lunch and he has a food in his stomach that might have flipped out of the air while we were serving ourselves. So gross

@brianab1188 assured her friends her son was okay, but decided to remind herself of these Bible verses to help her cope in the face of a potential health crisis.
To my knowledge he is fine. I’m going to call tomorrow just to double check. He had his first poop of the day and everything looked healthy so I am confident he is just fine. But I will call just to double check. It’s not a fun job, but thank you for your concern

"Following Sunday’s mass shooting in Las Vegas, many country musicians and fans have been wondering about guns and safety – about how far the government should act and whether people can still feel safe going to concerts.
But country legend Charlie Daniels has a different take on it.
“I feel like this is an anomaly,” said the Wilmington native, calling Friday from a tour stop in New Mexico. “I think this guy was a nut, a problem waiting to happen. I think if we let ourselves be made afraid of those kinds of things, we’re done and the bad guys have won.”
Country superstar Jason Aldean was performing at the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas Oct. 1, the last day of a three-day event, when a gunman opened fire from a nearby hotel room with high-powered weapons. Fifty-eight people were killed and more than 500 were injured.
That’s led to a vigorous debate about firearms and gun-control laws, particularly country music’s responsibility in it. The National Rifle Association has close ties with the country music industry through N.R.A. Country, which says on its website that it’s “powered by pride, love of country, respect for the military and our responsibility to protect our great American lifestyle.”

Rosanne Cash, a musician, gun control activist and daughter of the late Johnny Cash, penned a New York Times essay this week headlined, “Country Musicians, Stand Up to the N.R.A.”
Daniels hadn’t read Cash’s essay, but said, “Things happen, you know.”
“I’m not much of a ‘What if?’ guy,” he said. “‘What if a piece of an airplane falls on you out of the sky?’ Well, that’s probably not gonna happen. Same way with these things. You can’t worry about it.”
Daniels said he agrees with the National Rifle Association’s support of regulations on “bump stock” devices that convert semi-automatic weapons to automatic weapons. But he doesn’t agree with wider calls for stricter gun laws.
“I just wish people who actually knew something about guns would say something,” Daniels said. “Some of the politicians talking about gun control don’t know what the hell they’re talking about. A lot of things they call assault rifles are just deer rifles with a bigger magazine.
“If you want to see what the gun control that politicians talk about would do, look at Chicago,” Daniels added. “Chicago has some of the strictest laws in the country and it’s a damn slaughterhouse. That’s what would happen in America if the kind of gun-control laws (Sen.) Chuck Schumer and (Rep.) Nancy Pelosi want were to take place. You would leave people defenseless.”
Daniels will headline an Oct. 21 show at Cary’s Booth Amphitheatre.",1.0907407999038696,0,1
"Daniels has already spoken out on the subject, tweeting Monday that he believes stricter gun control is “pointless and an insult to the American way of life”:
If the gun control nuts would stop with their insane gun control laws and the politicians stop with their meaningless speeches, then Americans like Mr. Paddock, and the millions of other Americans who are sick, disturbed or have psychological problems would have to find an alternative way to vent their frustrations.
Stricter gun laws would be pointless and an insult to the American way of life. We would be handcuffed and helpless and that is not the way America came to be or the way our nation should remain.
Daniels has previously blasted gun control in wake of mass shootings. After June’s Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, Daniels wrote in an editorial for The Washington Times that guns are “the great equalizer” for those who want to protect themselves and their fellow citizens. Daniels wrote that guns are “the primary defense” against criminals, and he went on to tout the Constitution for “every red blooded American’s right to keep and bear arms.”
But in a July 2015 editorial for Fox News following a mass shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the musician advocated for a ban on fully automatic weapons. While Daniels argued that automatic weapons can be used for self defense, he wrote that the only weapon used by the attacker at Chattanooga was fully automatic. Daniels wrote that “our legislators should consider making it very difficult for anyone to purchase fully automatic firearms unless they are law enforcement, the military or a licensed hunter.”
On Monday, in an unrelated editorial in The Washington Times, Daniels wrote that the Las Vegas shooter’s actions “will become nothing more than another blip on the news barrage, another headline in an unending river of heartbreak. After a certain period, the headlines fade away to be replaced with the next story that captivates the public’s imagination.”
Daniels is hardly the only country artist to speak out on gun laws. Following a mass shooting in June 2016 at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, country singer Cam said on Good Morning America that she supports “stricter gun control.”

"Britain’s red carpet night for the stars of the silver screen took place last night at London’s Royal Albert Hall with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in attendance at the 70th edition of the BAFTAs. This was the first time the royal couple have been together on this red carpet, turning up the heat on the jewellery front, and Kate didn’t disappoint. Confirming the red-carpet trend, Kate chose large earrings over a statement necklace worn with her off-the shoulder floral print gown by Alexander McQueen.
The Duchess of Cambridge’s large chandelier earrings have us all guessing. According to the Daily Mail, Kensington Palace will not comment on whether they were a loan or from the Duchess’ own jewellery box, but they have had previous outings. Our hunch is that the jewels are by a British designer and that the pink stones are morganites – the Duchess has shown a preference for pastel-coloured gems – surrounded by old-cut diamonds.
These classic yet so very Kate earrings were possibly commissioned by the Duchess herself, but no jeweller worth her commission would dare to spill the beans, so we will just have to keep guessing. The articulated diamond bracelet looks like it might be an Art Deco jewel from the Queen’s personal collection. She was, of course, wearing her sapphire engagement ring.
Beyond the excitement caused by the Duchess of Cambridge, bold embroidered floral motifs on gowns were the main couture trend, dominated by Alexander McQueen, Gucci, Dior and Tom Ford. With embellished dresses a strong style statement, glamorous earrings to complement the decorative flourishes as opposed to showstopper necklaces marked the night.
After the Duchess of Cambridge, Emily Blunt was the most polished example of how to pair an elaborate gown with jewels. She wore her Alexander McQueen gown with Lorraine Schwartz jewels. In her lobes were a pair of 50-carat blue sapphire earrings and on her finger, a playful, lifesize, lifelike dragonfly ring that looked as if it had just fluttered out from the Oriental garden embroidered on her dress.

While it’s safe to say there were quite a few shocks and surprises on the night, especially with three of the five Best Picture nominees winning absolutely nothing, the most talked-about looks came from some of the biggest stars in attendance.
Jeff Bridges was the epitome of cool casual as he arrived with his Best Supporting Actor award and walked away with a Special Award for his services to cinema. “As I say to my wife when she goes out in the morning and she looks in the mirror: She’s the prettiest girl in the world.” he quipped.
Viola Davis became the first black actress to win a Leading Actress BAFTA Award, taking the accolade for her role in The Help. She looked amazing in a strapless white Alexander McQueen gown with a bejeweled bow at the neck and sleeves.
Sandy Powell took home Best Costume Design for her incredible work on The Young Victoria. She chose to go for a black-and-white 1920s beaded gown by Nina Ricci to take home her award – which we think was the perfect choice.
Meryl Streep, who picked up her 13th BAFTA, looked beautiful in a strapless Alexander McQueen gown with her glossy dark hair pulled back and pinned up in the back.
The best dressed men of the evening were Javier Bardem and Tin Tin‘s Jean Pires, who both wore Gucci tuxedos. Bardem had a lilac and purple check tie to break up the color.

As anyone with 175 career games under his belt surely knows, nothing lasts forever. Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer knows he isn’t getting any younger.
The veteran had most of his best years with the Bengals but, after a trade from Oakland to Arizona in 2013, he led the Cardinals to a 10-6 season — their best record since 2009.
He posted a 63.3 completion percentage for 4,274 yards, his best passing efficiency since 2007 (64.9 percent) and a then-career high in single-season passing yards.
MORE: Bickley: Cardinals' Carson Palmer can't wait for his last shot
Palmer suffered a torn ACL that derailed his 2014 season but Palmer was better than ever in 2015.
The veteran set career highs in wins (13), passing yards (4,671), yards per attempt (8.7) and QBR (78.6). Pro Football Focus named him a first-team All Pro; Palmer had never been named to any all-pro team by any publication.
However, the 37-year-old quarterback experienced a clear decline in performance in 2016, posting career lows since his time in Oakland in categories across the board.

The drop-off has called into question Palmer’s chances for a bounce-back season.
“I feel great. My body feels great like everybody in the league right now,” Palmer said in a conference call on Tuesday. “I’m excited about this year, this group and the opportunity in front of us.”
For Palmer, feeling is everything. For a player fifth among active quarterbacks in sack percentage (5 percent), it’s important to apply regular oversight to his health.
In fact, Palmer has been performing his yearly self-checkup since before his breakout 2015 campaign. The inflated numbers were nice to have, but it didn’t change how he viewed the rest of his career.
MORE: Cardinals' Carson Palmer says age is relative at QB position
“I’ve been telling my wife (for years) that this is the last one, but I take it one year at a time,” Palmer said. “I go through a process at end of the season to take stock.”
With lower expectations and an optimistic mindset, Palmer is looking to get back to doing what he loves — just playing the game.
“I love the game, working out, studying, every facet of it,” Palmer said. “As long as I have the ability and the health to play, and continue to enjoy it, I don’t want to stop.”
The underdog
Palmer believes the Cardinals’ 7-8-1 record in 2016 could be the best thing to happen to the team — and to him.
It’s an interesting disposition, especially considering that just a season prior the Cardinals claimed their first NFC West title since 2009 and won 13 games for the first time in franchise history. They also earned a first-round bye in the playoffs, another first for Arizona.
The Palmer-led Cardinals made a statement with a 26-20 overtime win over the Green Bay Packers in the divisional round at University of Phoenix Stadium, but could not contain Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers in a 49-15 road drubbing in the NFC title game.
MORE: Cardinals had more fun this spring, Bruce Arians says
Still, expectations remained high for the Cardinals entering 2016.
This, Palmer maintains, spelled doom for him and his teammates. But this year, the 14-year veteran signal caller is looking forward to being in a familiar role.
“I prefer the underdog role, and people are talking about other teams this year,” Palmer said. “It allows you to go about your work, not having to answer some questions that come with a 13-3 season.”
Palmer can feel the difference.
“I think there is definitely (less pressure),” Palmer said. “Coming off a below .500 season, it gives you a little more time to focus on your craft, doing your job, and I think our team prefers the underdog style as well.”

"uries, Kyler Murray’s growth & Week 6 vs. Seattle Seahawks
Closing the Book on the Eagles
October 13, 2021 admin Cardinals, NFC, NFL, Offseason, Roster 0
The Cardinals will need to improve on Monday night if they want to stay ahead of the Rams and 49ers and win the NFC West.
The Arizona Cardinals’ offense did some things well and others very poorly against the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday Night Football. Here are three things the Cardinals need to focus on heading into Week 6, against the Seattle Seahawks.
1. Run defense
Things are going to be rough this week without Chandler Jones, who will miss a couple of weeks while on the COVID list. It’s been an interesting year for Jones; while he has continued to play very well overall, he has had some sacks and quarterback hits wiped out by referees’ incorrect calls. Still, the defense will miss Jones’ presence and the fact that the Cardinals do not have a single proven pass rusher behind him.
It’s not ideal that the Cardinals’ best pass rusher will not be on the field when they travel to Seattle to face the Eagles’ offense. And for all their flaws, the Seahawks’ offense is better than the Eagles’ by quite a bit.
Sports Illustrated NFL Power Rankings: Cards Rise, Cowboys Rough Up
J.J. Watt Has Made This New Cardinals Team His Own
That’s why the Cardinals’ poor run defense was a problem this week. The Cardinals have the No. 4 run defense by DVOA this season and they have given up 445 rushing yards through four games. But they also have not faced a true run-first team yet this season, and the Eagles have the No. 3 run offense and rushed for 222 yards and averaged 5.1 yards per carry against Arizona.
Ezekiel Elliott is one of the most talented backs in the NFL, and he averaged just 2.9 yards per carry. Jonathan Taylor of the Indianapolis Colts averaged 4.3 yards per carry.

"The second-quarter earnings season has been hailed by Wall Street’s equity bulls, who point to the better-than-expected results as proof that the stock market’s lofty levels were justified by the rise of activity in U.S. corporations.
S&P earnings grew 11% in the second quarter, the second straight quarter of double-digit growth, according to data from Goldman Sachs, the fastest two quarters of growth since 2011. More than half of S&P companies topped forecasts, the highest percentage since the second quarter of 2010, although the average upside surprise was 4%, slightly below the long-term average of 5%.
Despite the strength in the quarter, results in the first half of the year “have not been strong enough to warrant positive S&P 500 [earnings per share] revisions,” Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients. Of the S&P 500’s 11 primary sectors, it noted, forecasts for 2018’s profits have come down for six of them.
The average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet see S&P 500 SPX, +1.00% earnings of $141.81 a share in 2018. That’s down 0.2% from the $142.15 a share estimate that was forecast at the end of June.
Forecasts have come down even more for the remainder of the current year. For 2017, analysts see earnings of $130.46 a share for the S&P 500. That’s down 3.5% from the $135.25 that was forecast at the end of April. The S&P has risen 3.5% since that date.
It isn’t uncommon for estimates to be pared back as analysts and investors get more clarity about what economic conditions will look like, and the current tapering of expectations is less severe than is typical. The 0.2% decline for 2018 earnings is narrower than the 2% reduction that is typical when investors look out to the coming year, while the view for the second half of the year is also milder. Whereas forecasts have come down by 4% since March, per Goldman, the 30-year average reduction in estimates is 9%.
Opinion: The charts say S&P is heading into a ‘treacherous’ pullback
Despite that, the investment bank—led by chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin—expects 2018 forecasts to drop 5% from current levels. In particular, it wrote that the market consensus was “overly optimistic primarily on energy earnings growth.”
Even though major U.S. stock-market indexes rose throughout the second-quarter earnings season, with both the Dow DJIA, +0.62% and the Nasdaq COMP, +1.34% hitting records, there were signs that investors were unimpressed even with better-than-expected results in the quarter.
According to data from BlackRock, U.S. companies that topped consensus forecasts on both earnings and sales barely rose in the day after their earnings, relative to their benchmark. In the first quarter, such companies outperformed by nearly 1%, in aggregate.
In comparison, stocks from Europe, Japan, or emerging markets that posted better-than-expected results saw much more pronounced rises in the second quarter. Meanwhile, U.S. companies that just missed on revenue sold off more than stocks from other regions that did, while the names that reported worse-than-expected results on both metrics were sharply punished following the results.
“Equity markets have greeted positive earnings reports largely with indifference. Investor sentiment shows more signs of fatigue than euphoria, even as stock markets have repeatedly reached new highs this year,” said Richard Turnill, BlackRock’s global chief investment strategist.
Investors “may be on to something,” he added. “It will be more difficult for companies to achieve the same EPS growth in the second half, as the earnings recovery in the second half of 2016 is a higher hurdle.”
Despite that, he forecast “solid fundamentals and returns” going forward, “with the latter largely tracking earnings growth.”",1.0538997650146484,0,1
"underlying strength of corporate earnings.
However, a closer look at corporate earnings reports tells a different tale of the companies that are holding the stock market’s gains.
There are a few themes to emerge from the second-quarter earnings season. These include falling sales, increased borrowing and a surge in share buybacks to shore up earnings.
According to Goldman Sachs, which put out a report Tuesday, revenues in the S&P 500 Index have fallen for three straight quarters, making it the worst quarter in terms of year-over-year declines since 2009. In total, sales fell 1.4 percent year-on-year and 3 percent when excluding the energy sector.
Goldman Sachs also said that the S&P 500 companies that have announced earnings results over the past five weeks have generated more debt at a faster pace than in the last five years, and it warned that rising debt burdens are leading to reduced investment in the overall economy.
The increase in debt raises questions about how much longer corporates can keep on borrowing to shore up earnings.
There is also growing evidence that companies have turned to share buybacks to prop up earnings. According to Goldman Sachs, buybacks now account for 100 percent of the S&P 500’s aggregate earnings, “up from 58 percent in 2013, and 73 percent in 2016.”
Wall Street has long argued that share repurchases boost economic growth and corporate profits while reducing inflationary pressures.
The latest data, however, has sparked concern from economists, who say that rising stock prices caused by buybacks and dividend payouts are masking underlying economic problems.
One of the chief issues with Wall Street’s current equity valuations is the fact that many large-cap stocks are trading at lofty price-to-earnings ratios. Investors generally argue that stocks that have P/E ratios lower than 15x are good value, while those that trade at prices above 25x are overvalued. The average S&P 500 P/E ratio is 25.3, well above",0.914202868938446,1,1
"LEXINGTON, Ky. – The 2018-19 Kentucky roster has been left without a scholarship junior or senior again — at least for now.
Sophomore forward Wenyen Gabriel announced Wednesday he will begin his professional career instead of returning to school for his junior season.
“BBN, thank you for supporting me for the last two years and being patient with me through these last few weeks,” Gabriel said in a video posted to Twitter. “This process hasn’t been easy for me and it’s choosing between a lifelong dream and playing in front of a fan base that I’ve grown to love so much. Opportunities like these don’t come without the support and encouragement from my family, Coach Cal, the coaching staff, my teammates, and of course, the fans.
“I’ve enjoyed every moment of this journey at the University of Kentucky and I just want to thank everyone for who has supported me through both my ups and my downs. Lord knows this hasn’t been easy, but my time here has only better prepared me for what the future has for me.
“After receiving positive feedback, my dreams of becoming a professional basketball player are that much closer to reality. I believe that I’m ready to take that jump and will be keeping my name in the 2018 draft.”
To the best fans in the world, I couldn’t be more honored to have worn that Kentucky name across my chest for the p… twitter.com/i/web/status/1… —
UPMΛN™ (@WenyenGabriel) May 30, 2018
Gabriel declared for the draft without hiring an agent on April 18 despite not being including among ESPN's top 100 prospects for the 2018 draft, saying he was confident he could ""play at the next level"" but wanted to be ""absolutely certain"" starting his professional career was the right decision at this time by eliciting feedback from NBA teams.
Of the six UK players who declared for the draft after the season, Gabriel was the only one not to receive an invitation to the NBA's scouting combine.
As a sophomore, Gabriel, a former South Sudanese refugee who grew up in New Hampshire after moving to the United States as a toddler, averaged 6.8 points and 5.4 rebounds per game while starting seven of Kentucky's 37 games. He shot 39.6 percent (42-for-106) from 3-point range and led the Wildcats with 40 blocked shots.
It's NBA draft decision day: Will these UK players return next season?

Also: PJ Washington withdraws from NBA draft and will return to Kentucky
The highlight of Gabriel's season came in the SEC Tournament semifinals when he hit all 7 of his 3-point attempts en route to a team-high 23 points in a win over Alabama.
""Wenyen’s game is where the league continues to trend towards,” UK head coach John Calipari said in a news release confirming the decision. “He’s a position-less big man who can shoot, guard multiple positions and is willing to do what it takes to win. Wenyen grew so much from his freshman season to his sophomore year. If he continues to make those same strides, he’s going to carve himself a role with a team. He and I have talked and he knows he’s going to have to work hard to get there, but I’m confident he can.”
Since the end of the season, UK has lost Kevin Knox, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Hamidou Diallo to the draft and Sacha Killeya-Jones and Tai Wynyard to transfers.
Freshman forward PJ Washington announced he was returning to UK earlier Wednesday, and multiple national reports suggested the Wildcats could add Stanford graduate transfer Reid Travis to next season's roster.
Both Washington and Travis play Gabriel's position. UK also will feature 2017-18 starter Nick Richards and five-star recruit EJ Montgomery in the post positions, clogging the path to the number of minutes Gabriel might have needed to improve his stock.
At the combine earlier this month, Calipari said he had talked with multiple teams that had worked out Gabriel.
""One team told me yes, the other team told me no,"" Calipari said. ""But the good news about this league: You only have to have one team that likes you. The other 29 can say you stink, but if that one likes you, they take you.""
Gabriel seems likely to start his professional career overseas or in the NBA's developmental league.
Travis will be a fifth-year senior next season. His addition would ensure Kentucky does not play a second consecutive season without a scholarship junior or senior, but for now Washington, Richards and point guard Quade Green, each entering their second season at Kentucky, are the most experienced scholarship players on the roster.

"Friday he has been granted a waiver and is eligible to transfer without sitting out a year. He intends to graduate and leave the program and announced his decision to leave on Twitter.
""Kentucky has allowed me to dream big and chase my dreams, but in order to get back on track with my personal goals I must make this tough decision to begin to build another foundation at another school,"" Gabriel wrote in the post. ""This is not an easy decision as I have many things going on in my life right now which made my decision even tougher but I need to make a decision and continue to focus on my future. My love and heart for Kentucky and the University will always be with me. Thank you to the University of Kentucky for allowing me to be a Wildcat!""
Gabriel's departure from the roster further depletes the roster. After the departure of the 2017-18 roster, which included five-star freshmen Hamidou Diallo and Kevin Knox along with former Kentucky star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the only scholarship player back on the roster from last year is point guard Quade Green.
Kentucky opened the season without E.J. Montgomery on the roster. He remains suspended indefinitely after being arrested in October and charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated, possession of marijuana, and drug paraphernalia. P.J. Washington was suspended for the team's exhibition opener earlier this month.
A school spokesman has told the Lexington Herald-Leader that ""any eligibility issues are addressed by the NCAA,"" adding that there ""is no decision"" to be announced regarding Washington.
Junior college transfer Keldon Johnson is not considered a candidate to be ruled eligible to play this season and instead would redshirt before debuting for the Wildcats next year as a sophomore. He is expected to participate in practice.
Kentucky lost three recruits last spring, including two consensus top-25 players in the 2019 recruiting class. Zion Williamson, the presumptive preseason National Player of the Year, chose Duke instead. Darius Garland, the other star player in the '19 class, committed to Vanderbilt on Nov. 1",1.0260521173477173,1,1
"Happy Friday once again and welcome to Super Bowl LII weekend.
The New England Patriots will play the Philadelphia Eagles Sunday evening in Minneapolis, MN in Super Bowl LII and if you’re like me, you’re praying for an asteroid to hit Earth in the next 48 hours. Assuming that doesn’t happen, I suppose all of us fans of the Pittsburgh Steelers should probably be pulling for the Eagles to upset the Patriots.
I plan on sitting back on Sunday and eating 50 wings ahead of the Super Bowl getting underway.
We’ll have a game thread going on Sunday as well and invite all of you to participate in it. I might even run a contest ahead of time.
Enough chit chat, below are your Friday night five questions and I hope several of you have time to answer each one of them along with the two bonus questions in the comment section below.
Peace and love, peace and love! Have a safe Super Bowl weekend.
Go Eagles!
1 – Name one team from the AFC and NFC that did not make the playoffs this season that will do so next season. Also, name one team from the AFC and NFC that made the playoffs this season that won’t make it next season.
2 – Where will quarterback Kirk Cousins be playing in 2018?
3 – Over/under 22.5 total completions for Eagles quarterback Nick Foles in Super Bowl LII?
4 – The result of the Super Bowl LII coin-flip will be heads or tails?
5 – Over/under 74.5 receiving yards for Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski in Super Bowl LII?
Bonus #1 – For 8 points, without going over the actual number, what will the combined total be of points scored plus explosive plays of 20 yards or longer plus total turnovers?
Bonus #2 – Will former Steelers guard Alan Faneca be voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame Saturday night?
Recap of Senior Bowl Week Friday Night Questions:
Question 1 – An optimistic response of 14 yes; believe that a long-term contract will be signed without having to tag Le’Veon Bell. Alan Tman even laid out the terms: $45 million over 3 years with $28 million guaranteed over 2 years. It would be spread this way: 18-15-12. The 11 naysayers don’t see the Steelers offering more than last year nor Bell taking an offer he has already turned down. Stay tuned.
Question 2 – Alabama LB Rashaan Evans is the Senior Bowl player that we would most like to see in a Steelers uniform. He got 5 votes. Next with 3 votes is Oklahoma LB Ogbonnia Okoronkwo. Six players got 2 votes each: Texas A & M Safety Armani Watts; UCF LB Shaquem Griffin; Hawaii Safety Trayvon Henderson; Colorado State WR Michael Gallup; USC LB Uchenna Nwoso; & San Diego State RB Rashaad Penny. Texas DT Poona Ford & Oklahoma QB Baker Mayfield each got one mention. Dave Bryan’s version 1.0 mock draft and Alex Kozora’s Senior Bowl mock draft both mention at least one of your senior bowl favorites.
Question 3 – Although 18 indicated that they would watch XFL compared to 7 who said no – the support was rather soft when looking at the comments such as Mike Manzo’s, “Only if I’m walking past the tv and it’s on.”
Question 4 – The first question worth points this week. With the Killer B’s playing we thought that Ben, Brown & Bell would rack up some fantasy points. Our median response was 23 points scored with all that talent out there. A killer B did score some fantasy points, but it was Chris Boswell who saved the Steelers from being goose egged. Darth Blount 47 low balled his prediction and pegged it at 6 points. The next closest was a couple people with 14. Well done!
Question 5 – The killer B’s did contribute to the longest touchdown in this year’s Pro Bowl. Ben Roethlisberger’s pick-6 pass was returned for 79 yards and Wes Lee pegged that for 10 points. Well done!
This week is the last opportunity to unseat Alan Tman who has been in first place since Week 8! This is a big weekend for the NFL since the latest class of the Hall of Fame will be announced along with the MVP and offensive & defensive players of the year will be announced. It was already revealed that Tom Brady won the MVP since someone caught a photo of his acceptance speech but perhaps Antonio Brown will get the offensive player of the year. This may also be Alan Faneca’s year to receive the Gold Jacket.

And to be honest, the number will be significantly higher than what I have ever made on a sporting event.
Super Bowl props are the best to me — my favorite prop betting market.
I bet a few sports, but I am not a “sports” bettor. I love NFL, and Super Bowl props are my niche.
I get my best value — and my best payouts — in betting on the NFL.
For more than half of Super Bowl week, I’ve been working to complete 132 different prop bets, and I’ve been getting the odds together for my players.
That’s right, my players.
Most of my Super Bowl bets are available to my clients (subscription and one-time fees) and the rest are available here for free.
But even this year, I’m not sure I would have ever put this much time and effort into my NFL Super Bowl prop betting service without the success and encouragement I’ve had throughout Super Bowl week.
This is my 7th Super Bowl, 11th year in the business and I have to tell you, I’m more excited about Super Bowl Sunday than ever before.
I had a few bets on Super Bowl LI and I actually won a 6-figure bet.
But last year, I was so busy working on this year’s Super Bowl bets that I barely made time to wager on the Super Bowl.
That was a mistake, because I wasn’t able to enjoy the game as much as I should have.
And my business model that year was pretty much a failure.
This year has been different for me and the Super Bowl LII edition of my NFL prop betting system is an improvement on last year’s bets.
I’m getting a ton of positive feedback from my clients this year and it is a fun week of wagering for everyone.

"BEIJING, May 31 (Reuters) - China's vast manufacturing sector grew at the fastest pace in eight months in May, blowing past expectations and easing concerns about an economic slowdown even as risks from trade tensions with the United States and a crackdown on debt point to a bumpy ride ahead.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Thursday rose to 51.9 in May, from 51.4 in April, and remained well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the 22nd straight month.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the reading would dip slightly to 51.3.
Production expanded at the fastest rate in six months in May while growth in new orders rose to an 8-month high, helped by rising commodities prices.
The strong manufacturing sector readings defy concerns about an expected loss of momentum in the world's second-biggest economy, as policymakers navigate debt risks and rocky trade relations with the United States.
In particular, export orders improved from the previous month. Some economists suspect that Chinese firms have been front-loading shipments due to the Sino-U.S. trade frictions.
On the whole, however, economists were sceptical of the sustainability of industrial sector strength, suggesting the broader economy will face pressure over coming months.
""We doubt this strength will be sustained for long given that it appears to mostly reflect a temporary boost to industrial output from the easing of pollution controls rather than a turnaround in underlying demand,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, in a note after the data release.
Nomura analysts were also of the view the strong PMI readings will be short-lived, saying ""the growth of end-demand, such as infrastructure and property investment, has slumped in recent months, due at least in part to the government´s deleveraging efforts.""
SMALL FIRMS FACE FUNDING PRESSURES
Beijing has been tightening controls on riskier investments, the shadow banking business and speculation in the property sector, but has been keen to keep the broad economy well funded.
The industrial sector, a key source of jobs, remained in healthy shape, with profits growing at their fastest pace in six months, underpinned by continued strength in the steel sector.
But the latest survey showed that more manufacturers were concerned about tightening in funding over recent months, with 40.1 percent of all firms polled raising the issue in May, according to Zhao Qinghe, an official with the statistics bureau.
""Big cost pressure is still one of the major problems facing Chinese manufacturers these days,"" said Zhao.
Activity of small firms contracted in May after expanding the previous month while both big and medium-sized companies all posted positive growth.
Hi-tech manufacturing activity rose to 54.8 in May, up from April's 53.8, despite pending U.S. tariff list under its intellectual property probe and restrictions on Chinese investments in the U.S.
Washington said on Tuesday that it was moving forward with its threat to apply tariffs on Chinese imports worth up to $50 billion, reviving fresh worries of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Trade tensions had ebbed only recently after Beijing pledged to buy more from the United States.
China's economy grew at a slightly faster-than-expected pace of 6.8 percent in the first quarter. However, signs of stress were evident with investment growth slowing to a near 20-year low in April and growth in retail sales sliding.
Boosted by government infrastructure spending, a resilient housing market and unexpected strength in exports, China's manufacturers helped the economy deliver strong growth last year.
Economists still expect China's economic growth to slow to 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017, citing rising borrowing costs, tougher limits on industrial pollution and a crackdown on local governments' spending to keep their debt levels in check.
A sister survey showed growth in China's service sector also picked up pace in May, with the official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edging up to 54.9 from 54.8 the previous month.
A sub-reading for construction activity, a major driver of growth in 2017, stood at 60.1 in May, down from 60.6 in April.
Chinese policymakers are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports. The services sector now accounts for over half of the economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending clout.
A composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services activity rose to 54.6 in May, from April's 54.1.

"as trade tensions with the United States simmer.
The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) was the highest since September 2017, the data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed.
A separate PMI from private sector research firm Caixin/Markit was due later on Thursday, with a reading of 50 expected after the flash PMI of 50.2 last month.
The solid official PMI could also put pressure on the central bank to not cut borrowing costs too soon to support the slowing economy, as that may make it difficult to continue controlling asset bubbles in the financial sector, analysts said.
""I think it will make the PBOC (People's Bank of China) and policymakers a bit more cautious with regards to monetary easing. It will make them hesitant to do more stimulus,"" said Hao Zhou, emerging market economist at Commerzbank.
Analysts were already saying China's economy was showing signs of stabilising after a rough patch, with industrial output and investment both outperforming expectations in April and setting up for a strong second quarter.
China's economy grew 6.4 percent year-on-year in January-March, slightly above market expectations and the weakest in a decade but the trade war is seen as only one of the risks as the world's second-biggest economy struggles to transition towards new growth drivers.
A slew of stimulus measures unveiled by China in late 2016 and early 2017, including some US$450 billion in infrastructure spending, has helped to revive the economy but it faces more headwinds in 2019 from slower domestic demand and faltering exports, even as growth stabilises.
The official manufacturing PMI was the highest since September 2017, coming in at 50.8, above the 50.5 mark forecast in a Reuters poll and the 50.5 reading in April. The May reading was also the highest since the survey began in January 2004.
The PMI released on Thursday does not include data from Hubei province, which reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases outside China's ep",1.0062663555145264,1,1
"THE best thing about readers submitting their own memories of old Dewsbury is that their recollections often remind us of things we may have forgotten.
Their reminiscences also prompts other readers to come forward with their memories, and soon, week after week, we are able to record some fascinating pieces of social history.
BATLEY JAZZ CLUB: The smallish man in the middle is John Kilburn. The man behind him looking as though he is resting his head on him is John Cooper. Tony Hudson is at the right of them in the white shirt and dark tie making an equal triangle of heads. Barry Jackson is on the extreme left.
The other week, former Hanging Heaton milkman, Ronnie Ellis, delighted readers with his memories of the days when he and his dad had a milk round in Batley Carr.
He mentioned the many pubs which once existed there and also the shops and mills, which got a response from other readers eager to share their memories of Batley Carr.
Peter Gibbard last week wrote about the bomb which blew up his house in Old Bank Road, Dewsbury, during the Second World War.
Others have since written about another bomb which fell in Wakefield Road, killing a man working at Ridings Pit.
There was also another bomb dropped in Savile Town round about the same time which resulted in other fatalities.
It seemed enemy planes were trying to blow up the railway goods yard which once stood on land where stores like Sainsbury’s now stand.
Hopefully, I will be able to research more details of these tragedies and include them in forthcoming articles, all thanks to readers coming forward with their memories..
This week I received an email from Tony Hudson, a former Wheelwright Grammar School boy, who now lives in South Africa.
He remembers the rich culture which once existed in Dewsbury, and sends this delightful picture of a group of “Likely Lads” enjoying a night out at Batley Jazz Club.
Tony contacted me after reading Ronnie Ellis’s memories of Batley Carr which made him remember all the times he walked through this village on his way to his father’s place of work – A.N Cook – in Bradford Road.
Tony was born in Staincliffe in 1936 and moved to Mirfield when he was four years old, later attending Wheelwright Grammar School.
He did, however, have a strong connection with Batley Carr where his father, Eric Hudson, was a partner in the textile company of A.N Cook.
Many people who walked on Bradford Road in those days will also remember the firm.
I certainly do because I was always entranced by the lovely leaded window on which was inscribed the name A.N. Cook.
How many times did I wonder what these initials stood for, and now I know, thanks to Tony. They were the initials of his godfather, Arthur Norman Cook.
Tony writes: “It was with a certain degree of nostalgia that I read Margaret Watson’s article about Ronnie Ellis’s memories of Batley Carr.
“My schooling commenced at Dewsbury Wheelwright Grammar School in the kindergarten class which was situated in the girl’s grammar school. This later moved down the road to the boy’s school in Birkdale Road.
“It was from here that after school I used to cross over Halifax Road and wend my way down to my dad’s company in Batley Carr.
“After work, as a real treat, he would take me down to the Playhouse Cinema in Dewsbury where we had high tea in the cafe there.
“It comprised mainly of beans on toast or egg and chips, a real treat at that time served by a waitress in the standard black dress and white apron.
“After tea dad would take me into the cinema to watch the likes of Betty Grable and Harry James or early Abbot and Costello films.
“I remember some of the places I used to visit as I would walk from Dewsbury along Bradford Road.
“The first shop I came to was an “outdoor living” shop that sold tents of all shapes and sizes, primus stoves, knives, everything one would need to go camping.
“From this shop, for my birthday, I was bought a small ridge tent in which I spent many happy hours camping on our lawn.
“Just past this shop on the left side of the road was the company of S. Beaumont, another of our family friends.
“Apart from the textile activity in Batley Carr, there was also the cycle shop of Bill Hargreaves who had an original Penny Farthing cycle outside his shop, and I always wondered if anyone knew how to ride it.
“As I grew older our school modified our hours of attendance which meant we had Tuesday and Thursday afternoons free, but had to make this up by attending on Saturday morning.
“A crowd from our form used to go to the roller skating rink on a Tuesday afternoon. It was closed on Thursday afternoon for skating as it was being prepared for the evening function –wrestling.
“Stars at that time were Jack Pye, Hassan ali Bey, The Farmer and the Farmer’s Boy.
“This eventually came to an end when the building was sold and became the site for the Batley Variety Club.
“I remember while at school experiencing all kinds of music available locally from the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra to brass band concerts and loud dance band music as I passed the record department f J W Thornes at the bottom of Daisy Hill.
“Best of all was a live session listening to the Johnny Dankworth Seven with an 18 year old Cleo Laine.
“This was above Burton’s Tailors in Batley. I guess the owners were jazz fans like me because I also heard Tito playing there with Terry Devon. How’s that for name dropping!
“From time to time I have to visit England and Dewsbury and I enjoy walking through the places I used to know and frequent.
“Even though times have changed I see that Dewsbury has kept pace of the times.”

Mrs Beryl Green sent me a memory of her time on Dewsbury Moor, when she lived in Woodthorne Lane.
She had been surprised when I mentioned the name of Mr Fred Firth in a column.
It was the name of a friend of her mother, who lived just up the road from the Green family.
""The name was also familiar to me from my time as a young teacher at the now demolished Mill Bank Infants School, where Mr Firth's family ran a bakery on Mill Bank Road.
""I remember taking my class there for a school trip and thinking what a great idea it was to actually take my charges into a bakery to see how bread was made.
""Another trip for the same class was on the train to York and, returning home, the boys were all singing a silly song all about the number 2, which I still can't get out of my head!
""Sadly I am now living many miles from Dewsbury and would love to hear from anyone else who remembers me or my family from that time.""
Mrs Anne Banks emailed me to say: ""My husband's grandfather, Arthur Banks, was also known as 'Curly', which, as a young man he was, complete with full head of curly hair.
""It seems he was an old school friend of Mr Firth's.
""I remember as a young girl having many conversations about the boys together, especially when visiting my aunties and uncles around Dewsbury.
""My husband has many fond memories of visiting his grandparents and the Firth family.""
Their recollections prompted Mr Ron Hirst to send me his own memory of Mr Firth.

"It turns out, the oyster aphrodisiac myth not be a myth at all. You may have heard that they'll get you in the mood because oysters are high in zinc, which is linked to high testosterone levels and in rats. I've also heard it's because eating an oyster is similar to giving oral sex to a woman, which I don't understand because I've definitely never done that in a Red Lobster. But as far as oysters leading to sex is concerned, there may be science to back this idea up.
New research from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which looked at data of 501 couples who were trying to get pregnant, shows that eating seafood is linked to having more sex — and higher pregnancy rates. They study went on for four years, where couples were each followed for one year or until pregnancy was detected. And the results were clear — more seafood intake was associated with having more sex and fecundity — which essentially just means fertility or the ability to produce offspring. Say it with me: fecundity. More seafood, higher fecundity.
Basically, the research found that 92 percent of the couples who ate fish and shellfish at least twice a week were able to get pregnant within the year. They also found that those who ate the most fish and shellfish — to the tune of eight or more times a month — had a 22 percent higher rate of sexual activity than average. So if you're trying to get pregnant — or just have more sex life — you may want to pass the lobster.
The researchers actually didn't set out to prove the link between seafood and sexual intercourse, so the results were a shock to them too. ""We are not sure what exactly is driving this association,"" Audrey J. Gaskins, Sc.D., Research Associate at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, tells Bustle. ""For example, the original reason why shellfish such as oysters were linked to increased libido was due to their high zinc content. Studies have shown that in humans, dietary zinc intake has a positive correlation with testosterone levels and in rats that zinc therapy improves sexual competence. However, given that we did not measure zinc intake in our study and zinc is found in many other foods other than seafood, we felt uncomfortable making this link in our study.""
Gaskin also says there's a possible behavioral explanation for the link. ""It is also possible that couples who consume higher amounts of seafood together share more meals and thus more time together (including nights) which may be a behavioral explanation for the association we observed with sexual activity,"" she says.
So now you know. But that's not the first time a link between food and sex has been proven. Take a look at some of the connections below.
1 Millennials Like Food As Much As Sex Andrew Zaeh for Bustle In 2016, a survey from Havas Worldwide and Market Probe International, of almost 12,000 adults of all ages, found that 54 percent of millennials believed that food is on the same level as sex. Millennials are far more likely to put food that high on the list than other generations — as only 42 percent of Baby Boomers said the same.
2 Guacamole Can Help You Hook Up Andrew Zaeh for Bustle Whether you're looking for love or sex, certain foods can help you get there. Zoosk, the dating platform, looked at 3,733,185 dating profiles and 364,609,566 first messages and found that food was often associated with a higher response rate. For example, mentioning guacamole in a message got you 114 percent more replies than not mentioning it. It really is the way to our hearts — and our everything else.
3 An Apple A Day Can Help Your Roll In The Hay Andrew Zaeh for Bustle This is one reason to get your five-a-day. Research published in the journal of Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics found that apples can actually stimulate sexual arousal in women. The research found that apples can improve lubrication and overall sexual function. Just something to keep in mind the next time you're at the grocery store.
4 Men And Women Think About Sex More Than Food Andrew Zaeh for Bustle A 2011 study from psychologists at Ohio University found that women think about sex about once every 50 minutes, compared to men who think about it every 28 minutes. When it comes to food, women think about it every 62 minutes — while men tended to think about it every 38 minutes. So let me get this straight: Some women think about food less than once an hour? The average woman does? I have never met any of these women. I want to take my own poll about how many seconds pass between me thinking about bread. If I can get the number up to 20, I win.",1.0422276258468628,0,1

The problem is, there's no solid evidence to support the claim that eating oysters will increase your sex drive—or help with erections.
We put out our own call to find you some oysters that are actually aphrodisiacs (not that we don't think they're delicious, because we think they're delicious). We found some at The Raw Kitchen and in the wild at Greenpoint Fish & Lobster in Brooklyn. The chef at the Raw Kitchen, Jessica Russo, told us that she's been known to give one to some of the most skeptical male customers who come in. He who would not be named, an owner of the shop, says they're his favorite. They're tiny—roughly half the size of a quarter—and a pretty pale grey. But their smooth, sweet taste is irresistible. They come from a farm in Maine that also supplies other restaurants around town, like Café Cluny. And while their reputation as an aphrodisiac isn't well known, we hope you'll find this recipe for Oysters Rockefeller irresistible, too.

3 tablespoons Pernod (or similar anise-based liquor)
2 tablespoons freshly grated lemon zest
½ tablespoon fresh lemon juice
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

1 tablespoon chopped parsley
In a blender, puree the bread with the remaining ingredients except for the butter and parsley. You should have a fine, smooth, and flavorful paste. Heat the butter in a skillet over medium-low heat.

SINGAPORE Malaysia's Petronas has pitched an estimated $1 billion stake in a prized upstream local gas project to potential bidders including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N), Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP.BK) and Japanese firms, sources familiar with the matter said.
If successful, the deal could mark Petronas' biggest upstream stake sale since oil prices started declining more than two years ago. Petronas is targeting lowering operating expenses, job cuts and project rollbacks to help it navigate through the low oil price environment.
Citing sources, Reuters reported in February that Petronas was considering selling a stake of as much as 49 percent in the SK316 offshore gas block in Malaysia's Sarawak state.
The state-owned oil and gas company has approached about a dozen prospective buyers including global oil majors and Asian firms focussed on Southeast Asia, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the talks are private.
They said Petronas has begun providing financial and operational data to the companies and expects to receive bids over the next few weeks.
""It's just what the environment is. Nobody wants to keep all the risk on their books,"" said Vikas Halan, senior credit officer, corporate finance group at Moody's, adding he viewed the move as a rebalancing of Petronas' portfolio.
""Petronas is the leader in the oil and gas space, especially on the gas side. The experience of getting or producing LNG and marketing LNG is quite an interesting one and Petronas becomes a logical choice for players,"" he said.
In a statement to Reuters, Petronas said that through its subsidiary, Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, it is looking for partners who can bring the technology and capabilities to explore, develop and efficiently operate the various fields and opportunities in the SK316 offshore gas block.
""We are confident that we will attract the right partners to maximise the potential value of these opportunities to help meet the world's growing oil and gas demand,"" Petronas said.
It was not immediately known what the individual companies' response to Petronas' approach was.
One financial source said a minority stake might not appeal to non-Asian oil majors but a decision to bid would depend on details of the stake being offered, valuations and the potential for long term partnerships with Petronas.
ExxonMobil declined to comment, while Shell referred the query to Petronas. A spokeswoman for PTTEP declined to comment on the deal but said the company was keen to invest in Southeast Asia because it had expertise in the region where costs and risks were low.
Gas from the NC3 field in the SK316 block feeds Malaysia's LNG export project, known as LNG 9, Petronas' joint venture with JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp (5020.T) that began commercial production in January.
Petronas could use the funds from the stake sale to develop the Kasawari field in the same block. The field is one of the largest non-associated gas fields in Malaysia and has an estimated recoverable hydrocarbon resource of about three trillion standard cubic feet.
""Kasawari will require a significant capital investment to develop due to the high CO2 content,"" said Prasanth Kakaraparthi, senior upstream research analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
""In a lower-for-longer oil price world, it makes commercial sense for Petronas to farm down its interest and partner with companies that have innovative CO2 handling technology,"" he said.
Petronas put on hold plans to develop the field in 2015 after oil and gas prices fell, according to media reports.

KUALA LUMPUR - Petronas Dagangan Bhd, the downstream arm of state-run energy firm Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas), said on Friday that its core net profit rose 25.4% last year, boosted by sales volume growth and a weaker ringgit.
The company, which is known as Petronas Dagangan, posted a profit of 1.51 billion ringgit ($365.4 million) in the year ended Dec. 31, compared with 1.20 billion ringgit a year ago, according to a statement on its website.
Petronas Dagangan's core net profit excludes exceptional items. It is expected to post higher profit for the first quarter of 2017, supported by higher sales and marketing activities, the statement added.
The company, which also operates the Petronas-owned BHPetrol fuel stations, increased volume in its domestic market by more than 3.6% to 3.75 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. In 2015, its volume was 3.63 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Petronas Dagangan's earnings were also boosted by lower costs from the weakening of the local currency.
The ringgit tumbled more than 20% against the US dollar last year, its worst performance since the Asian currency crisis in 1998.
For the first quarter of 2017, Petronas Dagangan expects its volume to grow by 12% as the company benefits from its retail expansion and the reintroduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) by the government in April 2015.
In 2016, Petronas Dagangan opened a 59-pump station in Langkawi and expects to open another 54 stations in the first quarter of 2017.

"Dry conditions plagued Montana this summer, with multiple wildfires torching over 1 million acres throughout the state. The largest fire, the Lodgepole Complex fire, impacted over 270,000 acres. Recent rain and snow, and the forecast for continued precipitation, help to suppress the fires and provide welcome relief for Montana residents.
Fires aren't too uncommon in Montana, but this year's fire season has been different. Spring brought plenty of moisture from an abundant snow-pack and provided adequate moisture for grass growth. The moisture quickly depleting leaving most of the state in drought condition.
""Ranchers saw this as great grass and feed. Firefighters saw it as fuel,"" said Dennis Garcia, Farm Service Agency (FSA) county executive director for Glacier County, Montana. Garcia was activated to serve in the National Guard during the wildfire suppression efforts near Lolo, Montana.
FSA provides assistance to farmers and ranchers who have been impacted by natural disasters, including wildfires, by administering a suite of safety-net programs to help producers recover from eligible losses, such as the Livestock Indemnity Program, the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program, and the Tree Assistance Program. The programs can assist farmers and ranchers who lost livestock, grazing land, fences or eligible trees, bushes and vines as a result of the qualifying natural disaster.
The Lolo Peak Fire, southwest of Lolo, Montana, has impacted over 53,000 acres. The National Guard was activated to help with evacuation efforts near the wildfire.
In addition, the FSA Emergency Conservation Program provides funding and technical assistance for farmers and ranchers to rehabilitate farmland damaged by natural disasters. Low-interest emergency loans are available to help producers recover from production and physical losses. Compensation is also available to producers who purchased coverage through the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, which protects non-insurable crops (including native grass for grazing) against natural disasters that result in lower yields, crop losses or prevented planting.

As a result of the ongoing drought conditions, all Montana counties were approved for emergency haying and grazing of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres. Due to drought and fire conditions, 53 of the state's 56 counties have been declared either primary or contiguous disaster areas.
""The short term impact is FSA can do a lot of good for producers. Producers can get some relief, fix fences and get feed purchased,"" Garcia said.
Garcia said hay donations came into the state from other areas to help out ranchers in need. Additionally, FSA employees from other states, including Missouri and Oklahoma, have spent time helping Montana producers enroll in FSA disaster programs.
""It is proof that the agriculture community is one big small town where you have a lot of folks that have camaraderie,"" he said.

After the fire, many ranches and communities throughout Montana are in the midst of cleanup, recovery, and preparation efforts as winter approaches. Some efforts being made include the removal of fence lines, rebuilds of water catchments and troughs, repairing pastures and water crossings, and removing trees and brush burned by the fire. One ranch, the Blackburn Ranches, was particularly impacted and is seeking to recover and thrive following the loss of many structures and livestock that burned in the fire.
Blackburn Ranches in Musselshell, Montana, in the wake of the fire
The Blackburn Ranches lost 40% of their grazing acreage due to the fire, and many fence lines were compromised in the process. This loss of land resulted in the ranch having to implement an alternative feeding strategy to get their cows ready for the winter, as grass was no longer available in the area. The ranch relied on a mobile grazing strategy, which is an approach that moves cows on a regular basis to use the remaining vegetation and improve the remaining grazing land. However, moving a large herd of cows can be a challenge, as it requires a large number of vehicles and people to help gather the cows, and the cows must be contained to avoid losing any.
The Blackburn Ranches relied on their neighbors and ranching community to assist with the herding efforts, and ranchers from around the area came to help. Many of the ranchers in the area were affected by the fire, but still came to help as they are part of a tight-knit community.
