PAOLI, IN (WAVE) - Like many American towns, Paoli has evolved with the times.
The changing of the decades show in the decrepit drive-in movie theater. Something that you now just drive by.
However, there's one thing in Paoli that hasn't changed one bit. A full service gas station stands right next to the downtown roundabout.
""We pump the gas for you, wash your windshields, and they get pretty happy about that,"" Daniel McCabe said.
>> More Community news on wave3.com
McCabe is a newbie at Riley Oil Company. He said he started back in August after he lost his other job. He also said it was pretty cool knowing that he is one of the few who hold the position of gas pump assistant.
Customers who come by said it's a treat from the past.
""You don't necessarily want to get out and pump your own gas and here you can stay in your car and just do it that way,"" Loretta Brown said.
McCabe said he especially enjoys the small talk, getting to know residents of Paoli. Owners Jo Ann and Jeff Riley said that's their favorite part too.
""You get out there and you talk to so many people,"" Jo Ann Riley said. ""Everybody has a story and every story is different.""
Riley said the royal treatment has been around for decades.
""It started in 1971,"" Riley said. ""Glendon Riley, which is my husband's father -- he opened it.""
Since then, not once did the business stray from the most important thing: family. It's a Riley empire, honestly.
""Me, Troy, Eric, dad, Jodie, Jackie, so we have six?"" Jeff Riley said, counting the family members on his fingers. ""Six Riley's that work here.""
Jo Ann explained the family continues to grow.

""There are already great-grandbabies being born so I imagine it will be in the family for a long time,"" Jo Ann said. She added that the service they provide is a dedication to their customers.
""A lot of places will say they'll pump it for a penny more,"" Jo Ann said. ""We're not going to charge you a penny more.""
The miles have meaning alright. At Riley's a gallon takes you through generations.
""It's just family everywhere, you know it's just family,"" Riley said. ""We just, I think we have gas running through our veins instead of blood sometimes.""

"She's openly shared pictures of the stretch marks covering her thighs, and now Chrissy Teigen is lifting the lid on stretch marks during pregnancy and what she does to avoid them.
The 32-year-old who is mom to two-year-old Luna is due to give birth to her second child, a son, in June.
And speaking to Refinery29, the searingly honest author and model explained that as she's from 'a real stretch mark-prone family', she's had stretch marks for years.
Honest: Model and author Chrissy Teigen, 32, has opened up about the products she uses during pregnancy to avoid stretch marks
Go-tos: Chrissy's routine includes Aquaphor, $4.99, Lumière Concentrate, $85.95, and coconut oil
Lucky: Mom to two-year-old Luna and due to give birth to her second child, a son, in June, Chrissy admitted to Refinery29 that her belly is the one place she doesn't get marks
'I had stretch marks way before the baby. Mine went to my inner thighs for some reason — my thighs just got really angry one year.'
Referencing an Instagram post from August 2015 where her stretch marks on her thighs could clearly be seen, she added that she didn't post her 'stretchies for the praise'.
'I post[ed] it because [of] the wine also I like the pattern and they're so soft.'
However that doesn't mean she's complacent when it comes to preventing them on her belly during pregnancy and shared that for her, it's all about prevention.
'Sometimes, we only take care of our skin when we see a breakout happening, but with stretch marks, it's all about prevention,' she said.
And she's a big fan of getting the whole family involved: 'I'm big now, so it's hard for me to bend over. John helps me a lot with everything at the end of the night. Luna loves helping out.
'It's exhausting to do this 10-15 minute session of lubing up your belly and body, with all these different layers, especially when you're like, ""I don't even have a stretch mark yet!""'
Admitting that as she has naturally dry skin, Chrissy uses a combination of products to keep her skin soft, smooth and stretch mark free, and uses budget drugstore brand Aquaphor on her elbows, along with coconut oil all over her body.
Prep: However, she spends 10-15 minutes per night applying products to her belly to prevent any scarring and says prepping the skin before any stretching occurs is key
Family affair: Chrissy also shared that she gets her husband John Legend and daughter Luna also help out every night
Stretchies say hi: Chrissy has been open about her battle with stretch marks in the past and posted this candid shot of her stretch mark covered thighs in April 2015
However, her favorite products come from high-end skincare brand Lumière de Vie because - as she candidly confessed during the interview - she gets it for free.
'Honestly, a lot of it comes from Lumière because I worked with them and they send it to me,' she explained.
'That's one of the only beauty campaigns I did where it was like, I would do this for products. I don't need money, I don't need anything — Lumière is just such an incredible product.'
She uses the brand's concentration on her belly, 'especially around the sides because you never know where stretch marks are going to pop up.'
'The only place I don't have stretch marks on my body is my belly. The other places that have them are from regular wear and tear of my body,' she added.
However, Chrissy also shared that she's never seen a woman without stretch marks, and detailed how every model she's worked with has had at least one.
'I've worked with every supermodel in the world. I'm lucky to know that the most incredibly beautiful women all have stretch marks and all have the butt dimples. It really is our common bond.'",1.0231759548187256,0,1
"...them. In a recent interview, Teigen revealed that she has embraced her body’s changes throughout her pregnancies, emphasizing the importance of self-acceptance. “I’ve learned to love my stretch marks as part of my journey,” she said. 

To help manage the appearance of stretch marks, Teigen shared her skincare routine, which includes moisturizing with rich creams and oils. She swears by products that contain cocoa butter and hyaluronic acid, claiming they keep her skin hydrated and elastic. 

Teigen also highlighted the role of genetics in skin elasticity, noting that some women may be more prone to stretch marks than others. “It’s all about being kind to yourself and understanding that your body is doing something incredible,” she added. 

Her candidness has resonated with many, encouraging others to embrace their bodies and the changes that come with motherhood. Teigen’s message is clear: beauty comes in all forms, and self-love is essential.",0.701683759689331,1,1
"OCEANSIDE — Lifeguard David Wilson was honored this week for a heroic water rescue that saved a life.
The rescue occurred July 17, 2016. Wilson was on unit patrol at Harbor Beach tower 14 along with veteran lifeguard Mike Wagner.
“It was a pretty busy day,” Wilson said.
He began his day instructing students in the Junior Lifeguard Program. He then continued to put in patrol hours due to sizable summer crowds and rough seas.
Earlier that afternoon he was part of several land and sea rescues, including getting a child out of a locked sweltering car.
Then came a distress call about a solo jet skier crashed on the jetty at the mouth of the harbor. The location of the accident is nicknamed the “devil’s triangle” due to the dangers the rock jetty poses.
Wilson responded and found the man thrown off the jet ski, semiconscious, wedged between two boulders and unable to free himself. He attempted to free the man as consistent sets of pounding waves hit him and the victim.
While Wilson aided the victim a city harbor officer pulled up in a patrol boat and lent a hand in the difficult rescue. The two were able to put a lifejacket under the victim’s head as a buoy.
To set the man free, Wilson needed to dive underwater and release the victim’s legs. Eventually the pair dislodged the man, but not without getting knocked down by waves and enduring some major scrapes from the surrounding rocks, which Wilson described as a cheese grater.
“It seemed forever, we got beat up pretty well, yelling ‘brace’ between waves,” Wilson said.
A city firefighter arrived and the three pulled the victim from the rocks between sets of waves, up onto a stretcher and to an awaiting air ambulance. Due to HIPPA privacy laws the name of the victim has not been released.
“No doubt that without his iron effort, knowledge and skill in the ocean environment, a life would have been lost,” Capt. Bill Curtis, Oceanside Fire Department Lifeguard Division, said.
“David knowingly placed himself in harm’s way with one goal and an incredible outcome.”
For most the work day would end there, but Wilson showered off his cut leg and returned to duty to help with an issued code five alert. That afternoon he pulled 20 people from the harbor’s choppy waters.
“It’s one of the crazier situations I’ve been in,” Wilson said.
Code five rescue operations involved every lifeguard on duty. Wilson said to aid multiple people in distress his partner paddled out on a rescue board, directed a group of five people to hold on and Wilson swam two of them at a time into shore.
“It was a good day with a positive outcome,” Wilson said.
Despite his long day and injuries Wilson was at the Junior Lifeguard Program the following morning instructing potential future guards.
The recognition ceremony for his heroism took place in Sacramento on Sept. 25. Out of 21 applicants Wilson was the only one to receive the prestigious Governor’s Public Safety Medal of Valor this year.
Wilson grew up in Oceanside and has served as a city lifeguard since 2012. He just completed criminal justice studies and plans to pursue a career as a State Beach peace officer ranger/lifeguard.
He said his career path was inspired by fellow Oceanside lifeguards whose rescues have become legend.
“There aren’t a lot of people in this profession who get recognized for their amazing feats,” Wilson said. “I’m beyond blessed being able to do this.”
Last year Oceanside beaches saw more than 4 million visitors. Lifeguards prevented more than 82,000 accidents and performed in excess of 3,000 water rescues.",1.0889570713043213,0,1
"...Oceanside Beach when he noticed a commotion in the water. A swimmer had been caught in a rip current and was struggling to stay afloat. Without hesitation, Wilson sprang into action, diving into the turbulent waves. He swam against the current, reaching the distressed swimmer just in time. With his training and experience, Wilson was able to secure the swimmer and guide them back to safety.

The swimmer, a local resident, expressed immense gratitude for Wilson's quick response and bravery. ""I truly believe he saved my life,"" they said during the ceremony where Wilson was recognized. The Oceanside Lifeguard Association presented him with a commendation for his courage and dedication to public safety. 

City officials praised Wilson's actions, highlighting the importance of lifeguards in ensuring beachgoers' safety. ""David exemplifies the spirit of our community and the commitment of our lifeguards,"" said the mayor during the award presentation.",0.730940043926239,1,1
"The Great Southern Storm have named an initial colts squad of 45 players under a new coach as they prepare for the Great Southern Colts Carnival in Kulin next month.
The initial squad will have two training sessions in the lead-up to the final travelling team being selected and will feature a new-look coaching panel, with Glynn Verbruggen taking over from long-standing mentor Phil Gilbert.
Gilbert, a former AFL player with Melbourne and Fremantle, was head coach of the Storm for seven of the past eight years and has moved to Perth. Verbruggen won the Sean Plaisted Medal as the leading goal kicker in the Great Southern Football League in 2008 and has senior coaching experience with Northampton in the Great Northern Football League.
Recently Verbruggen has been in charge of the Claremont 15s development squad and was excited by the challenge of being announced as the Storm’s head figure.
“I’m really excited to take over as the senior Storm coach,” he said.
“I’ve stayed away from coaching senior football down here for this chance and the aim was to take over from Phil when he left.
“The opportunity has come up and I’m really keen to get in and help with the talented kids from the region.”
A strong squad has been named this week featuring a host of young players who are regulars at league level, while State 16 squad members Heath Spinks and Jacob Blight have also been included.
Squad members Fraser Eaton, Bryce Blaszkow, Tom Wolfe, Taj Williams, Lachy O’Shea, Ted Batchelor, Hayden Parker and Aidin Williss have already played State Country colts this season.
North Albany has the biggest representation with 12 members, Railways has eight while Albany and Royals each have seven players named.
“It will be good to get a look at all the talented kids over two sessions and over the next two rounds of local footy,” Verbruggen said.
“It’s a really even squad with a lot of younger age kids and we definitely will be very competitive at Kulin.”
The squad will train at Railways on June 4 and 11, from 5.30pm.

"She seemed to let slip that she was expecting a baby boy during an appearance on RTE One's Cutting Edge earlier this month, before trying to cover it up.
But Vogue Williams confirmed the worst-kept secret in the world on Instagram stories on Tuesday when she referred to the baby as 'he'.
She looked incredible posing in a sexy black swimsuit and joked that you can only see the bump from the side.
Stunning: Pregnant Vogue Williams showed off her blossoming bump in a black one-piece as she enjoyed some time in Hong Kong on Tuesday
The big reveal: She confirmed that she is in fact expecting a boy as she referred to her baby as 'he' - she did it once before on a TV show earlier this month but tried to backtrack
Posing in a Hong Kong bathroom in the swimsuit which had cut-out sections at the side, the model wrote: 'Wearing my girl @melissaodabash.'
She wrote on a picture of herself from the side, she added the caption: 'Don't worry, he's still here,' next to a cry-face emoji.
Vogue's soon-to-be sister-in-law Pippa Middleton is said to be expecting her first child at the same time as her.
And on Sunday, she slipped into a bikini in the garden just hours after claims that another Matthews baby was on the way.
That morning, it was reported that James Matthews, the older brother of Vogue's fiance Spencer, was 'overjoyed' to be expecting his first child with wife Pippa, who happens to be the Duchess of Cambridge's little sister.
Bumping along: Vogue posted another side profile bump shot on Sunday, after lashing out at claims she edited her baby bump in a front on shot last week
Currently bumping along nicely with her own pregnancy, Vogue shared a bump picture as she enjoyed the London sunshine.
The Irish model looked glorious in a little golden bandeau bikini, exposing her pregnancy shape as she turned to one side and posed while standing on a garden bench with her dog.
She wrote beside it: 'I should be packing but it’s sooooo sunny and I have a new bikini and sunglasses!'

'These photos were taken within half an hour of each other,' she explained. 'Front on no bump, side profile POW there he is! So glad my bump has finally popped.
'I never alter my body in any pictures, if you can’t see my bump it’s just because of the angle although I may only take side profile shots from now on!'
B UT Spencer and Vogue have just got back from a glorious babymoon in Crete.
Bidding farewell to the holiday spot, they posted a loved-up holiday snap via Instagram on Thursday morning.

"By partnering together to promote the adoption of cybersecurity best practices, the NTSC and CSA will aim to improve vendor security. Specifically, the two organizations will help standardize and improve cloud security vendor reviews by promoting and strengthening the CSA's Security, Trust & Assurance Registry (STAR) and related CSA tools as recommended practices for cloud security and vendor evaluations.
""We are excited to partner with the NTSC to make common cause toward raising the bar for cloud computing security and all new emerging technologies,"" said Jim Reavis, CEO of Cloud Security Alliance. ""CSA STAR is the world's largest cloud computing assurance program which, combined with NTSC's focus on CISO advocacy, will help accelerate trust of the cloud while preventing key stakeholders from reinventing the wheel.""
The NTSC and CSA are seeking to streamline the vendor security review process; reduce time, energy, and effort by encouraging best practices for vendors; and offer benefits to vendors who abide by this process and best practices. Together, the organizations will collaborate on a STAR-based questionnaire that maps to the most used compliance frameworks. A joint whitepaper will then provide information about this program, how CISOs can incorporate this program into their companies, and how vendors would incorporate the program when planning to work with organizations.
""The information security industry needs to evolve the way it assesses and improves cloud vendor security,"" said Patrick Gaul, Executive Director of the NTSC. ""CISOs don't have the same kind of transparency with third party cloud security vendors as they do with their own network systems. I'm excited that the preeminent CISO and cloud security auditing associations are partnering together, and we look forward to promoting a more rigorous way to help CISOs vet cloud security vendors based on CSA's successful STAR program.""
In addition to partnering on a cloud security vetting program, the CSA and the NTSC will also participate in each other's events, discuss industry issues in working groups, and collaborate on research involving cloud security. The NTSC encourages dialogue about cybersecurity issues, laws, and regulations through advocacy engagement with congressional members, regional CISO policy roundtables, and an annual DC Fly-In as part of its National CISO Policy Conference. The CSA holds many conferences, summits, events, and forums around the world to promote the use of best practices for providing security assurance within cloud computing.
About Cloud Security Alliance
The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is the world's leading organization dedicated to defining and raising awareness of best practices to help ensure a secure cloud computing environment. CSA harnesses the subject matter expertise of industry practitioners, associations, governments, and its corporate and individual members to offer cloud security-specific research, education, certification, events and products. CSA's activities, knowledge and extensive network benefit the entire community impacted by cloud — from providers and customers, to governments, entrepreneurs and the assurance industry — and provide a forum through which diverse parties can work together to create and maintain a trusted cloud ecosystem.

"By LAURIE KELLMAN
WASHINGTON — The nation’s political leaders bowed their heads for a solemn salute Wednesday to the Rev. Billy Graham in the soaring Capitol Rotunda, paying tribute to a man who ministered to presidents and other Americans of both parties.
“Here lies America’s pastor,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, gesturing to Graham’s casket under the eye of the dome, surrounded by family, friends, lawmakers and a ring of paintings of the nation’s founders. “He ministered to all walks, from some of the greats whose statues line this hall_Eisenhower, King, Ford, and Reagan_to the everyday citizens lining up today to pay their respects.”
President Donald Trump said his father was an admirer of Graham’s and that the “legendary” American figure deserved to be recognized in the place “where the memory of the American people is enshrined.”
Graham’s influence stretched far beyond the city where he counseled lawmakers to a global flock over the better part of seven decades.
“The man we recognize today shared the Gospel with more people, face-to-face, than anyone else in history,” said Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
As the leaders stood by the casket, Trump reached out to touch the bare wood and Ryan bowed his head.
Graham died a week earlier at age 99. Some 30 family members are accompanying Graham’s casket to Washington, where he befriended presidents of both parties and counseled others over seven decades. Graham’s son, Franklin, tweeted a photo Wednesday of family members loading the casket onto a jet emblazoned with “Samaritan’s Purse,” the name of a Christian relief charity that he chairs.
Graham is lying in honor before a funeral Friday near his home in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Rotunda entrances were draped with black fabric, and Graham’s casket rested on a black-draped catafalque beneath the soaring ceiling and its painting, the “Apotheosis of Washington.”
Though he met every president since Harry Truman and counseled most, Graham grew wary of politics after Watergate. He was closest to Richard Nixon but later said he felt used by him.
Nonetheless, Graham ministered to other presidents until his health began to fail about 10 years ago.
Former President Bill Clinton recalled seeing one of Graham’s crusades as a child, a profound experience that became more amazing over his life. Graham counseled him as Arkansas governor, and later as president in the White House itself.
“In that little room, he was the same person I saw when I was 11 on that football field,” Clinton said Tuesday after viewing the casket at Graham’s home.
Former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, also visited Graham’s home on Tuesday.
In Washington, Ryan said there had been no doubt that Graham would receive the honor of a public viewing in the Rotunda. He told reporters that almost immediately upon hearing of Graham’s death he, Trump, McConnell and Rep. Patrick McHenry, who represents the Graham family’s district, agreed it would happen.
Graham shares the honor with 11 presidents and other distinguished Americans, starting with Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky in 1852 and, most recently, Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii in 2012, according to the House and the Architect of the Capitol.
Graham is only the fourth private person to lie in honor since 1998. The others are two U.S. Capitol Police officers who died in the line of duty in 1998 and civil rights hero Rosa Parks in 2005.
Trump met Graham at the pastor’s 95th birthday party in 2013, but is closer to Franklin Graham Jr.
On Friday, Trump was to attend Graham’s funeral near his library in Charlotte, North Carolina. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush will not be there, meaning no former presidents will attend the funeral.

"...the evangelical icon who passed away at the age of 99. Graham, known for his powerful sermons and ability to connect with millions, was honored in a ceremony that drew lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, reflecting his impact on American society and politics. 

House Speaker Paul Ryan praised Graham as a ""spiritual adviser to presidents"" and a man who ""brought hope to millions."" Senators and representatives shared personal anecdotes, recalling how Graham's messages of faith and love transcended political divides. 

The service featured readings from scripture and musical tributes, including hymns that Graham often used in his crusades. His casket, draped in a simple American flag, was surrounded by floral arrangements, symbolizing the respect he garnered throughout his life. 

As the nation remembers Graham's legacy, many reflect on his commitment to spreading a message of unity and compassion in a time of increasing division.",0.7887624502182007,1,1

"Following Sunday’s mass shooting in Las Vegas, many country musicians and fans have been wondering about guns and safety – about how far the government should act and whether people can still feel safe going to concerts.
But country legend Charlie Daniels has a different take on it.
“I feel like this is an anomaly,” said the Wilmington native, calling Friday from a tour stop in New Mexico. “I think this guy was a nut, a problem waiting to happen. I think if we let ourselves be made afraid of those kinds of things, we’re done and the bad guys have won.”
Country superstar Jason Aldean was performing at the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas Oct. 1, the last day of a three-day event, when a gunman opened fire from a nearby hotel room with high-powered weapons. Fifty-eight people were killed and more than 500 were injured.
That’s led to a vigorous debate about firearms and gun-control laws, particularly country music’s responsibility in it. The National Rifle Association has close ties with the country music industry through N.R.A. Country, which says on its website that it’s “powered by pride, love of country, respect for the military and our responsibility to protect our great American lifestyle.”

Rosanne Cash, a musician, gun control activist and daughter of the late Johnny Cash, penned a New York Times essay this week headlined, “Country Musicians, Stand Up to the N.R.A.”
Daniels hadn’t read Cash’s essay, but said, “Things happen, you know.”
“I’m not much of a ‘What if?’ guy,” he said. “‘What if a piece of an airplane falls on you out of the sky?’ Well, that’s probably not gonna happen. Same way with these things. You can’t worry about it.”
Daniels said he agrees with the National Rifle Association’s support of regulations on “bump stock” devices that convert semi-automatic weapons to automatic weapons. But he doesn’t agree with wider calls for stricter gun laws.
“I just wish people who actually knew something about guns would say something,” Daniels said. “Some of the politicians talking about gun control don’t know what the hell they’re talking about. A lot of things they call assault rifles are just deer rifles with a bigger magazine.
“If you want to see what the gun control that politicians talk about would do, look at Chicago,” Daniels added. “Chicago has some of the strictest laws in the country and it’s a damn slaughterhouse. That’s what would happen in America if the kind of gun-control laws (Sen.) Chuck Schumer and (Rep.) Nancy Pelosi want were to take place. You would leave people defenseless.”

"...should have the right to bear arms in the wake of such tragedies. The shooting, which left dozens injured and several dead, has reignited the debate over gun control in America. Many artists took to social media to express their condolences and call for change, with some advocating for stricter regulations on firearm sales and ownership.

In the days following the incident, several country music stars participated in discussions about mental health and the need for comprehensive background checks. Fans at concerts have also voiced their concerns, with some calling for venues to implement enhanced security measures to ensure safety during live performances.

As the country grapples with the aftermath of the shooting, the conversation around guns and safety continues to evolve. Musicians and fans alike are left to ponder the balance between personal freedoms and the need for a safer environment, both on and off the stage.",0.7064606547355652,1,1
"Britain’s red carpet night for the stars of the silver screen took place last night at London’s Royal Albert Hall with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in attendance at the 70th edition of the BAFTAs. This was the first time the royal couple have been together on this red carpet, turning up the heat on the jewellery front, and Kate didn’t disappoint. Confirming the red-carpet trend, Kate chose large earrings over a statement necklace worn with her off-the shoulder floral print gown by Alexander McQueen.
The Duchess of Cambridge’s large chandelier earrings have us all guessing. According to the Daily Mail, Kensington Palace will not comment on whether they were a loan or from the Duchess’ own jewellery box, but they have had previous outings. Our hunch is that the jewels are by a British designer and that the pink stones are morganites – the Duchess has shown a preference for pastel-coloured gems – surrounded by old-cut diamonds.
These classic yet so very Kate earrings were possibly commissioned by the Duchess herself, but no jeweller worth her commission would dare to spill the beans, so we will just have to keep guessing. The articulated diamond bracelet looks like it might be an Art Deco jewel from the Queen’s personal collection. She was, of course, wearing her sapphire engagement ring.
Beyond the excitement caused by the Duchess of Cambridge, bold embroidered floral motifs on gowns were the main couture trend, dominated by Alexander McQueen, Gucci, Dior and Tom Ford. With embellished dresses a strong style statement, glamorous earrings to complement the decorative flourishes as opposed to showstopper necklaces marked the night.
After the Duchess of Cambridge, Emily Blunt was the most polished example of how to pair an elaborate gown with jewels. She wore her Alexander McQueen gown with Lorraine Schwartz jewels. In her lobes were a pair of 50-carat blue sapphire earrings and on her finger, a playful, lifesize, lifelike dragonfly ring that looked as if it had just fluttered out from the Oriental garden embroidered on her dress.
Bulgari picked a winner as Viola Davis, below, raised her prize for Best Supporting Actress wearing a diamond Serpenti bracelet coiling up her arm and matching earrings along with her striped, flowing chiffon Jenny Peckham gown.

Pence emphasized the importance of treating all individuals, including pets, with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation.

The backlash against Oliver's book has sparked a heated debate on social media, with many defending the comedian's right to free expression while others argue that it crosses a line. Supporters of Pence have rallied around him, calling for a more respectful discourse in public life. Meanwhile, Oliver and his fans continue to celebrate the book as a satirical take on political figures, insisting that humor is a vital tool for challenging the status quo.

As anyone with 175 career games under his belt surely knows, nothing lasts forever. Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer knows he isn’t getting any younger.
The veteran had most of his best years with the Bengals but, after a trade from Oakland to Arizona in 2013, he led the Cardinals to a 10-6 season — their best record since 2009.
He posted a 63.3 completion percentage for 4,274 yards, his best passing efficiency since 2007 (64.9 percent) and a then-career high in single-season passing yards.
MORE: Bickley: Cardinals' Carson Palmer can't wait for his last shot
Palmer suffered a torn ACL that derailed his 2014 season but Palmer was better than ever in 2015.
The veteran set career highs in wins (13), passing yards (4,671), yards per attempt (8.7) and QBR (78.6). Pro Football Focus named him a first-team All Pro; Palmer had never been named to any all-pro team by any publication.
However, the 37-year-old quarterback experienced a clear decline in performance in 2016, posting career lows since his time in Oakland in categories across the board.

The drop-off has called into question Palmer’s chances for a bounce-back season.
“I feel great. My body feels great like everybody in the league right now,” Palmer said in a conference call on Tuesday. “I’m excited about this year, this group and the opportunity in front of us.”
For Palmer, feeling is everything. For a player fifth among active quarterbacks in sack percentage (5 percent), it’s important to apply regular oversight to his health.
In fact, Palmer has been performing his yearly self-checkup since before his breakout 2015 campaign. The inflated numbers were nice to have, but it didn’t change how he viewed the rest of his career.

“I’ve been telling my wife (for years) that this is the last one, but I take it one year at a time,” Palmer said. “I go through a process at end of the season to take stock.”
With lower expectations and an optimistic mindset, Palmer is looking to get back to doing what he loves — just playing the game.
“I love the game, working out, studying, every facet of it,” Palmer said. “As long as I have the ability and the health to play, and continue to enjoy it, I don’t want to stop.”
The underdog
Palmer believes the Cardinals’ 7-8-1 record in 2016 could be the best thing to happen to the team — and to him.
It’s an interesting disposition, especially considering that just a season prior the Cardinals claimed their first NFC West title since 2009 and won 13 games for the first time in franchise history. They also earned a first-round bye in the playoffs, another first for Arizona.
The Palmer-led Cardinals made a statement with a 26-20 overtime win over the Green Bay Packers in the divisional round at University of Phoenix Stadium, but could not contain Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers in a 49-15 road drubbing in the NFC title game.
MORE: Cardinals had more fun this spring, Bruce Arians says
Still, expectations remained high for the Cardinals entering 2016.
This, Palmer maintains, spelled doom for him and his teammates. But this year, the 14-year veteran signal caller is looking forward to being in a familiar role.
“I prefer the underdog role, and people are talking about other teams this year,” Palmer said. “It allows you to go about your work, not having to answer some questions that come with a 13-3 season.”
Palmer can feel the difference.
“I think there is definitely (less pressure),” Palmer said. “Coming off a below .500 season, it gives you a little more time to focus on your craft, doing your job, and I think our team prefers the underdog style as well.”

Somers emphasized the importance of the offensive line in protecting Murray and creating opportunities for the running game.

As the Cardinals look to bounce back from recent setbacks, both insiders expressed cautious optimism about the team's ability to compete. With the playoffs on the horizon, every game becomes crucial, and the Cardinals will need to capitalize on their chances against a tough Eagles squad.",0.7410526275634766,1,1
"The second-quarter earnings season has been hailed by Wall Street’s equity bulls, who point to the better-than-expected results as proof that the stock market’s lofty levels were justified by the rise of activity in U.S. corporations.
S&P earnings grew 11% in the second quarter, the second straight quarter of double-digit growth, according to data from Goldman Sachs, the fastest two quarters of growth since 2011. More than half of S&P companies topped forecasts, the highest percentage since the second quarter of 2010, although the average upside surprise was 4%, slightly below the long-term average of 5%.
Despite the strength in the quarter, results in the first half of the year “have not been strong enough to warrant positive S&P 500 [earnings per share] revisions,” Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients. Of the S&P 500’s 11 primary sectors, it noted, forecasts for 2018’s profits have come down for six of them.
The average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet see S&P 500 SPX, +1.00% earnings of $141.81 a share in 2018. That’s down 0.2% from the $142.15 a share estimate that was forecast at the end of June.
Forecasts have come down even more for the remainder of the current year. For 2017, analysts see earnings of $130.46 a share for the S&P 500. That’s down 3.5% from the $135.25 that was forecast at the end of April. The S&P has risen 3.5% since that date.
It isn’t uncommon for estimates to be pared back as analysts and investors get more clarity about what economic conditions will look like, and the current tapering of expectations is less severe than is typical. The 0.2% decline for 2018 earnings is narrower than the 2% reduction that is typical when investors look out to the coming year, while the view for the second half of the year is also milder. Whereas forecasts have come down by 4% since March, per Goldman, the 30-year average reduction in estimates is 9%.
Opinion: The charts say S&P is heading into a ‘treacherous’ pullback
Despite that, the investment bank—led by chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin—expects 2018 forecasts to drop 5% from current levels. In particular, it wrote that the market consensus was “overly optimistic primarily on energy earnings growth.”
Even though major U.S. stock-market indexes rose throughout the second-quarter earnings season, with both the Dow DJIA, +0.62% and the Nasdaq COMP, +1.34% hitting records, there were signs that investors were unimpressed even with better-than-expected results in the quarter.
According to data from BlackRock, U.S. companies that topped consensus forecasts on both earnings and sales barely rose in the day after their earnings, relative to their benchmark. In the first quarter, such companies outperformed by nearly 1%, in aggregate.
In comparison, stocks from Europe, Japan, or emerging markets that posted better-than-expected results saw much more pronounced rises in the second quarter. Meanwhile, U.S. companies that just missed on revenue sold off more than stocks from other regions that did, while the names that reported worse-than-expected results on both metrics were sharply punished following the results.
“Equity markets have greeted positive earnings reports largely with indifference. Investor sentiment shows more signs of fatigue than euphoria, even as stock markets have repeatedly reached new highs this year,” said Richard Turnill, BlackRock’s global chief investment strategist.
Investors “may be on to something,” he added. “It will be more difficult for companies to achieve the same EPS growth in the second half, as the earnings recovery in the second half of 2016 is a higher hurdle.”
Despite that, he forecast “solid fundamentals and returns” going forward, “with the latter largely tracking earnings growth.”",0.9757688641548157,0,1
"...resilience of corporate earnings. Major companies across various sectors have reported stronger-than-anticipated profits, driven by robust consumer spending and effective cost management strategies. Analysts noted that sectors such as technology and consumer discretionary have particularly outperformed, with firms leveraging innovation and adapting to changing market conditions.

Investors are now looking ahead to the third quarter, where expectations remain cautiously optimistic. However, concerns about inflation and potential interest rate hikes linger, prompting some market participants to question the sustainability of this growth. Despite these headwinds, many analysts believe that the underlying fundamentals of the economy remain strong, providing a solid foundation for continued market performance.

As earnings reports continue to roll in, the focus will shift to guidance for the remainder of the year, with investors eager to gauge how companies plan to navigate the evolving economic landscape. The upcoming weeks will be crucial in determining whether the current bullish sentiment can be maintained.",0.6490024924278259,1,1
"LEXINGTON, Ky. – The 2018-19 Kentucky roster has been left without a scholarship junior or senior again — at least for now.
Sophomore forward Wenyen Gabriel announced Wednesday he will begin his professional career instead of returning to school for his junior season.
“BBN, thank you for supporting me for the last two years and being patient with me through these last few weeks,” Gabriel said in a video posted to Twitter. “This process hasn’t been easy for me and it’s choosing between a lifelong dream and playing in front of a fan base that I’ve grown to love so much. Opportunities like these don’t come without the support and encouragement from my family, Coach Cal, the coaching staff, my teammates, and of course, the fans.
“I’ve enjoyed every moment of this journey at the University of Kentucky and I just want to thank everyone for who has supported me through both my ups and my downs. Lord knows this hasn’t been easy, but my time here has only better prepared me for what the future has for me.
“After receiving positive feedback, my dreams of becoming a professional basketball player are that much closer to reality. I believe that I’m ready to take that jump and will be keeping my name in the 2018 draft.”
To the best fans in the world, I couldn’t be more honored to have worn that Kentucky name across my chest for the p… twitter.com/i/web/status/1… —
UPMΛN™ (@WenyenGabriel) May 30, 2018
Gabriel declared for the draft without hiring an agent on April 18 despite not being including among ESPN's top 100 prospects for the 2018 draft, saying he was confident he could ""play at the next level"" but wanted to be ""absolutely certain"" starting his professional career was the right decision at this time by eliciting feedback from NBA teams.
Of the six UK players who declared for the draft after the season, Gabriel was the only one not to receive an invitation to the NBA's scouting combine.
As a sophomore, Gabriel, a former South Sudanese refugee who grew up in New Hampshire after moving to the United States as a toddler, averaged 6.8 points and 5.4 rebounds per game while starting seven of Kentucky's 37 games. He shot 39.6 percent (42-for-106) from 3-point range and led the Wildcats with 40 blocked shots.
It's NBA draft decision day: Will these UK players return next season?

Also: PJ Washington withdraws from NBA draft and will return to Kentucky
The highlight of Gabriel's season came in the SEC Tournament semifinals when he hit all 7 of his 3-point attempts en route to a team-high 23 points in a win over Alabama.
""Wenyen’s game is where the league continues to trend towards,” UK head coach John Calipari said in a news release confirming the decision. “He’s a position-less big man who can shoot, guard multiple positions and is willing to do what it takes to win. Wenyen grew so much from his freshman season to his sophomore year. If he continues to make those same strides, he’s going to carve himself a role with a team. He and I have talked and he knows he’s going to have to work hard to get there, but I’m confident he can.”
Since the end of the season, UK has lost Kevin Knox, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Hamidou Diallo to the draft and Sacha Killeya-Jones and Tai Wynyard to transfers.
Freshman forward PJ Washington announced he was returning to UK earlier Wednesday, and multiple national reports suggested the Wildcats could add Stanford graduate transfer Reid Travis to next season's roster.
Both Washington and Travis play Gabriel's position. UK also will feature 2017-18 starter Nick Richards and five-star recruit EJ Montgomery in the post positions, clogging the path to the number of minutes Gabriel might have needed to improve his stock.
At the combine earlier this month, Calipari said he had talked with multiple teams that had worked out Gabriel.
""One team told me yes, the other team told me no,"" Calipari said. ""But the good news about this league: You only have to have one team that likes you. The other 29 can say you stink, but if that one likes you, they take you.""
Gabriel seems likely to start his professional career overseas or in the NBA's developmental league.
Travis will be a fifth-year senior next season. His addition would ensure Kentucky does not play a second consecutive season without a scholarship junior or senior, but for now Washington, Richards and point guard Quade Green, each entering their second season at Kentucky, are the most experienced scholarship players on the roster.

"...forgo his remaining eligibility and declare for the NBA Draft. Gabriel, who averaged 5.1 points and 4.0 rebounds per game last season, expressed his gratitude to the coaching staff and fans in a heartfelt statement. ""I want to thank Coach Calipari and my teammates for believing in me and pushing me to be my best,"" Gabriel said. ""This program has been a huge part of my life, and I’m excited to take the next step in my career.""

His decision comes as a surprise to many, as he had shown flashes of potential throughout the season, particularly in key games. With Gabriel's departure, Kentucky will continue to focus on recruiting top talent to fill the void. Coach John Calipari is expected to bring in a strong class of freshmen, aiming to maintain the program's competitive edge in the SEC and nationally. The Wildcats will look to rebound from a disappointing tournament exit and build for the future.",0.7006078958511353,1,1
"Happy Friday once again and welcome to Super Bowl LII weekend.
The New England Patriots will play the Philadelphia Eagles Sunday evening in Minneapolis, MN in Super Bowl LII and if you’re like me, you’re praying for an asteroid to hit Earth in the next 48 hours. Assuming that doesn’t happen, I suppose all of us fans of the Pittsburgh Steelers should probably be pulling for the Eagles to upset the Patriots.
I plan on sitting back on Sunday and eating 50 wings ahead of the Super Bowl getting underway.
We’ll have a game thread going on Sunday as well and invite all of you to participate in it. I might even run a contest ahead of time.
Enough chit chat, below are your Friday night five questions and I hope several of you have time to answer each one of them along with the two bonus questions in the comment section below.
Peace and love, peace and love! Have a safe Super Bowl weekend.
Go Eagles!
1 – Name one team from the AFC and NFC that did not make the playoffs this season that will do so next season. Also, name one team from the AFC and NFC that made the playoffs this season that won’t make it next season.
2 – Where will quarterback Kirk Cousins be playing in 2018?
3 – Over/under 22.5 total completions for Eagles quarterback Nick Foles in Super Bowl LII?
4 – The result of the Super Bowl LII coin-flip will be heads or tails?
5 – Over/under 74.5 receiving yards for Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski in Super Bowl LII?
Bonus #1 – For 8 points, without going over the actual number, what will the combined total be of points scored plus explosive plays of 20 yards or longer plus total turnovers?
Bonus #2 – Will former Steelers guard Alan Faneca be voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame Saturday night?
Recap of Senior Bowl Week Friday Night Questions:
Question 1 – An optimistic response of 14 yes; believe that a long-term contract will be signed without having to tag Le’Veon Bell. Alan Tman even laid out the terms: $45 million over 3 years with $28 million guaranteed over 2 years. It would be spread this way: 18-15-12. The 11 naysayers don’t see the Steelers offering more than last year nor Bell taking an offer he has already turned down. Stay tuned.
Question 2 – Alabama LB Rashaan Evans is the Senior Bowl player that we would most like to see in a Steelers uniform. He got 5 votes. Next with 3 votes is Oklahoma LB Ogbonnia Okoronkwo. Six players got 2 votes each: Texas A & M Safety Armani Watts; UCF LB Shaquem Griffin; Hawaii Safety Trayvon Henderson; Colorado State WR Michael Gallup; USC LB Uchenna Nwoso; & San Diego State RB Rashaad Penny. Texas DT Poona Ford & Oklahoma QB Baker Mayfield each got one mention. Dave Bryan’s version 1.0 mock draft and Alex Kozora’s Senior Bowl mock draft both mention at least one of your senior bowl favorites.
Question 3 – Although 18 indicated that they would watch XFL compared to 7 who said no – the support was rather soft when looking at the comments such as Mike Manzo’s, “Only if I’m walking past the tv and it’s on.”
Question 4 – The first question worth points this week. With the Killer B’s playing we thought that Ben, Brown & Bell would rack up some fantasy points. Our median response was 23 points scored with all that talent out there. A killer B did score some fantasy points, but it was Chris Boswell who saved the Steelers from being goose egged. Darth Blount 47 low balled his prediction and pegged it at 6 points. The next closest was a couple people with 14. Well done!
Question 5 – The killer B’s did contribute to the longest touchdown in this year’s Pro Bowl. Ben Roethlisberger’s pick-6 pass was returned for 79 yards and Wes Lee pegged that for 10 points. Well done!
This week is the last opportunity to unseat Alan Tman who has been in first place since Week 8! This is a big weekend for the NFL since the latest class of the Hall of Fame will be announced along with the MVP and offensive & defensive players of the year will be announced. It was already revealed that Tom Brady won the MVP since someone caught a photo of his acceptance speech but perhaps Antonio Brown will get the offensive player of the year. This may also be Alan Faneca’s year to receive the Gold Jacket.

"BEIJING, May 31 (Reuters) - China's vast manufacturing sector grew at the fastest pace in eight months in May, blowing past expectations and easing concerns about an economic slowdown even as risks from trade tensions with the United States and a crackdown on debt point to a bumpy ride ahead.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Thursday rose to 51.9 in May, from 51.4 in April, and remained well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the 22nd straight month.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the reading would dip slightly to 51.3.
Production expanded at the fastest rate in six months in May while growth in new orders rose to an 8-month high, helped by rising commodities prices.
The strong manufacturing sector readings defy concerns about an expected loss of momentum in the world's second-biggest economy, as policymakers navigate debt risks and rocky trade relations with the United States.
In particular, export orders improved from the previous month. Some economists suspect that Chinese firms have been front-loading shipments due to the Sino-U.S. trade frictions.
On the whole, however, economists were sceptical of the sustainability of industrial sector strength, suggesting the broader economy will face pressure over coming months.
""We doubt this strength will be sustained for long given that it appears to mostly reflect a temporary boost to industrial output from the easing of pollution controls rather than a turnaround in underlying demand,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, in a note after the data release.
Nomura analysts were also of the view the strong PMI readings will be short-lived, saying ""the growth of end-demand, such as infrastructure and property investment, has slumped in recent months, due at least in part to the government´s deleveraging efforts.""
SMALL FIRMS FACE FUNDING PRESSURES
Beijing has been tightening controls on riskier investments, the shadow banking business and speculation in the property sector, but has been keen to keep the broad economy well funded.
The industrial sector, a key source of jobs, remained in healthy shape, with profits growing at their fastest pace in six months, underpinned by continued strength in the steel sector.
But the latest survey showed that more manufacturers were concerned about tightening in funding over recent months, with 40.1 percent of all firms polled raising the issue in May, according to Zhao Qinghe, an official with the statistics bureau.
""Big cost pressure is still one of the major problems facing Chinese manufacturers these days,"" said Zhao.
Activity of small firms contracted in May after expanding the previous month while both big and medium-sized companies all posted positive growth.
Hi-tech manufacturing activity rose to 54.8 in May, up from April's 53.8, despite pending U.S. tariff list under its intellectual property probe and restrictions on Chinese investments in the U.S.
Washington said on Tuesday that it was moving forward with its threat to apply tariffs on Chinese imports worth up to $50 billion, reviving fresh worries of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Trade tensions had ebbed only recently after Beijing pledged to buy more from the United States.
China's economy grew at a slightly faster-than-expected pace of 6.8 percent in the first quarter. However, signs of stress were evident with investment growth slowing to a near 20-year low in April and growth in retail sales sliding.
Boosted by government infrastructure spending, a resilient housing market and unexpected strength in exports, China's manufacturers helped the economy deliver strong growth last year.
Economists still expect China's economic growth to slow to 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2017, citing rising borrowing costs, tougher limits on industrial pollution and a crackdown on local governments' spending to keep their debt levels in check.
A sister survey showed growth in China's service sector also picked up pace in May, with the official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edging up to 54.9 from 54.8 the previous month.
A sub-reading for construction activity, a major driver of growth in 2017, stood at 60.1 in May, down from 60.6 in April.
Chinese policymakers are counting on growth in services and consumption to rebalance their economic growth model from its heavy reliance on investment and exports. The services sector now accounts for over half of the economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending clout.
A composite PMI covering both the manufacturing and services activity rose to 54.6 in May, from April's 54.1.

"...as the country navigates ongoing global uncertainties. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.9 in May, up from 51.4 in April, marking a significant rebound. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which is crucial for the world's second-largest economy.

Analysts had anticipated a more modest increase, reflecting worries over supply chain disruptions and weaker demand. However, the latest data suggests that government stimulus measures and a gradual recovery in domestic consumption are beginning to take effect. 

New orders surged, driven by both domestic and international demand, while production levels also saw a notable uptick. The employment sub-index, although still in contraction territory, showed signs of improvement, indicating that manufacturers are starting to hire again as confidence returns.

Economists remain cautiously optimistic, noting that while the May figures are encouraging, challenges such as rising raw material costs and geopolitical tensions could still pose risks to sustained growth.",0.766224205493927,1,1
"THE best thing about readers submitting their own memories of old Dewsbury is that their recollections often remind us of things we may have forgotten.
Their reminiscences also prompts other readers to come forward with their memories, and soon, week after week, we are able to record some fascinating pieces of social history.
BATLEY JAZZ CLUB: The smallish man in the middle is John Kilburn. The man behind him looking as though he is resting his head on him is John Cooper. Tony Hudson is at the right of them in the white shirt and dark tie making an equal triangle of heads. Barry Jackson is on the extreme left.
The other week, former Hanging Heaton milkman, Ronnie Ellis, delighted readers with his memories of the days when he and his dad had a milk round in Batley Carr.
He mentioned the many pubs which once existed there and also the shops and mills, which got a response from other readers eager to share their memories of Batley Carr.
Peter Gibbard last week wrote about the bomb which blew up his house in Old Bank Road, Dewsbury, during the Second World War.
Others have since written about another bomb which fell in Wakefield Road, killing a man working at Ridings Pit.
There was also another bomb dropped in Savile Town round about the same time which resulted in other fatalities.
It seemed enemy planes were trying to blow up the railway goods yard which once stood on land where stores like Sainsbury’s now stand.
Hopefully, I will be able to research more details of these tragedies and include them in forthcoming articles, all thanks to readers coming forward with their memories..
This week I received an email from Tony Hudson, a former Wheelwright Grammar School boy, who now lives in South Africa.
He remembers the rich culture which once existed in Dewsbury, and sends this delightful picture of a group of “Likely Lads” enjoying a night out at Batley Jazz Club.
Tony contacted me after reading Ronnie Ellis’s memories of Batley Carr which made him remember all the times he walked through this village on his way to his father’s place of work – A.N Cook – in Bradford Road.
Tony was born in Staincliffe in 1936 and moved to Mirfield when he was four years old, later attending Wheelwright Grammar School.
He did, however, have a strong connection with Batley Carr where his father, Eric Hudson, was a partner in the textile company of A.N Cook.
Many people who walked on Bradford Road in those days will also remember the firm.
I certainly do because I was always entranced by the lovely leaded window on which was inscribed the name A.N. Cook.
How many times did I wonder what these initials stood for, and now I know, thanks to Tony. They were the initials of his godfather, Arthur Norman Cook.
Tony writes: “It was with a certain degree of nostalgia that I read Margaret Watson’s article about Ronnie Ellis’s memories of Batley Carr.
“My schooling commenced at Dewsbury Wheelwright Grammar School in the kindergarten class which was situated in the girl’s grammar school. This later moved down the road to the boy’s school in Birkdale Road.
“It was from here that after school I used to cross over Halifax Road and wend my way down to my dad’s company in Batley Carr.
“After work, as a real treat, he would take me down to the Playhouse Cinema in Dewsbury where we had high tea in the cafe there.
“It comprised mainly of beans on toast or egg and chips, a real treat at that time served by a waitress in the standard black dress and white apron.
“After tea dad would take me into the cinema to watch the likes of Betty Grable and Harry James or early Abbot and Costello films.
“I remember some of the places I used to visit as I would walk from Dewsbury along Bradford Road.
“The first shop I came to was an “outdoor living” shop that sold tents of all shapes and sizes, primus stoves, knives, everything one would need to go camping.
“From this shop, for my birthday, I was bought a small ridge tent in which I spent many happy hours camping on our lawn.
“Just past this shop on the left side of the road was the company of S. Beaumont, another of our family friends.
“Apart from the textile activity in Batley Carr, there was also the cycle shop of Bill Hargreaves who had an original Penny Farthing cycle outside his shop, and I always wondered if anyone knew how to ride it.
“As I grew older our school modified our hours of attendance which meant we had Tuesday and Thursday afternoons free, but had to make this up by attending on Saturday morning.
“A crowd from our form used to go to the roller skating rink on a Tuesday afternoon. It was closed on Thursday afternoon for skating as it was being prepared for the evening function –wrestling.
“Stars at that time were Jack Pye, Hassan ali Bey, The Farmer and the Farmer’s Boy.
“This eventually came to an end when the building was sold and became the site for the Batley Variety Club.
“I remember while at school experiencing all kinds of music available locally from the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra to brass band concerts and loud dance band music as I passed the record department f J W Thornes at the bottom of Daisy Hill.
“Best of all was a live session listening to the Johnny Dankworth Seven with an 18 year old Cleo Laine.
“This was above Burton’s Tailors in Batley. I guess the owners were jazz fans like me because I also heard Tito playing there with Terry Devon. How’s that for name dropping!
“From time to time I have to visit England and Dewsbury and I enjoy walking through the places I used to know and frequent.
“Even though times have changed I see that Dewsbury has kept pace of the times.”

"It turns out, the oyster aphrodisiac myth not be a myth at all. You may have heard that they'll get you in the mood because oysters are high in zinc, which is linked to high testosterone levels and in rats. I've also heard it's because eating an oyster is similar to giving oral sex to a woman, which I don't understand because I've definitely never done that in a Red Lobster. But as far as oysters leading to sex is concerned, there may be science to back this idea up.
New research from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which looked at data of 501 couples who were trying to get pregnant, shows that eating seafood is linked to having more sex — and higher pregnancy rates. They study went on for four years, where couples were each followed for one year or until pregnancy was detected. And the results were clear — more seafood intake was associated with having more sex and fecundity — which essentially just means fertility or the ability to produce offspring. Say it with me: fecundity. More seafood, higher fecundity.
Basically, the research found that 92 percent of the couples who ate fish and shellfish at least twice a week were able to get pregnant within the year. They also found that those who ate the most fish and shellfish — to the tune of eight or more times a month — had a 22 percent higher rate of sexual activity than average. So if you're trying to get pregnant — or just have more sex life — you may want to pass the lobster.
The researchers actually didn't set out to prove the link between seafood and sexual intercourse, so the results were a shock to them too. ""We are not sure what exactly is driving this association,"" Audrey J. Gaskins, Sc.D., Research Associate at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, tells Bustle. ""For example, the original reason why shellfish such as oysters were linked to increased libido was due to their high zinc content. Studies have shown that in humans, dietary zinc intake has a positive correlation with testosterone levels and in rats that zinc therapy improves sexual competence. However, given that we did not measure zinc intake in our study and zinc is found in many other foods other than seafood, we felt uncomfortable making this link in our study.""
Gaskin also says there's a possible behavioral explanation for the link. ""It is also possible that couples who consume higher amounts of seafood together share more meals and thus more time together (including nights) which may be a behavioral explanation for the association we observed with sexual activity,"" she says.
So now you know. But that's not the first time a link between food and sex has been proven. Take a look at some of the connections below.
1 Millennials Like Food As Much As Sex Andrew Zaeh for Bustle In 2016, a survey from Havas Worldwide and Market Probe International, of almost 12,000 adults of all ages, found that 54 percent of millennials believed that food is on the same level as sex. Millennials are far more likely to put food that high on the list than other generations — as only 42 percent of Baby Boomers said the same.
2 Guacamole Can Help You Hook Up Andrew Zaeh for Bustle Whether you're looking for love or sex, certain foods can help you get there. Zoosk, the dating platform, looked at 3,733,185 dating profiles and 364,609,566 first messages and found that food was often associated with a higher response rate. For example, mentioning guacamole in a message got you 114 percent more replies than not mentioning it. It really is the way to our hearts — and our everything else.
3 An Apple A Day Can Help Your Roll In The Hay Andrew Zaeh for Bustle This is one reason to get your five-a-day. Research published in the journal of Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics found that apples can actually stimulate sexual arousal in women. The research found that apples can improve lubrication and overall sexual function. Just something to keep in mind the next time you're at the grocery store.
4 Men And Women Think About Sex More Than Food Andrew Zaeh for Bustle A 2011 study from psychologists at Ohio University found that women think about sex about once every 50 minutes, compared to men who think about it every 28 minutes. When it comes to food, women think about it every 62 minutes — while men tended to think about it every 38 minutes. So let me get this straight: Some women think about food less than once an hour? The average woman does? I have never met any of these women. I want to take my own poll about how many seconds pass between me thinking about bread. If I can get the number up to 20, I win.",0.9927206635475159,0,1
"...which plays a crucial role in testosterone production and overall sexual health. Recent studies have shown that zinc deficiency can lead to reduced libido and fertility issues in both men and women. Oysters, being one of the richest sources of zinc, can potentially enhance sexual desire and performance.

Moreover, oysters are also packed with amino acids that may trigger the production of sex hormones. The combination of these nutrients not only supports reproductive health but may also improve mood and energy levels, further contributing to a romantic atmosphere.

However, while the science behind oysters as an aphrodisiac is compelling, it’s essential to remember that individual experiences may vary. The setting, company, and personal preferences play significant roles in enhancing intimacy. So, whether you’re enjoying a plate of fresh oysters at a candlelit dinner or simply indulging in their unique taste, they might just add a little extra spark to your evening.",0.7203826308250427,1,1

SINGAPORE Malaysia's Petronas has pitched an estimated $1 billion stake in a prized upstream local gas project to potential bidders including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N), Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP.BK) and Japanese firms, sources familiar with the matter said.
If successful, the deal could mark Petronas' biggest upstream stake sale since oil prices started declining more than two years ago. Petronas is targeting lowering operating expenses, job cuts and project rollbacks to help it navigate through the low oil price environment.
Citing sources, Reuters reported in February that Petronas was considering selling a stake of as much as 49 percent in the SK316 offshore gas block in Malaysia's Sarawak state.
The state-owned oil and gas company has approached about a dozen prospective buyers including global oil majors and Asian firms focussed on Southeast Asia, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the talks are private.
They said Petronas has begun providing financial and operational data to the companies and expects to receive bids over the next few weeks.
""It's just what the environment is. Nobody wants to keep all the risk on their books,"" said Vikas Halan, senior credit officer, corporate finance group at Moody's, adding he viewed the move as a rebalancing of Petronas' portfolio.
""Petronas is the leader in the oil and gas space, especially on the gas side. The experience of getting or producing LNG and marketing LNG is quite an interesting one and Petronas becomes a logical choice for players,"" he said.
In a statement to Reuters, Petronas said that through its subsidiary, Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, it is looking for partners who can bring the technology and capabilities to explore, develop and efficiently operate the various fields and opportunities in the SK316 offshore gas block.
""We are confident that we will attract the right partners to maximise the potential value of these opportunities to help meet the world's growing oil and gas demand,"" Petronas said.
It was not immediately known what the individual companies' response to Petronas' approach was.
One financial source said a minority stake might not appeal to non-Asian oil majors but a decision to bid would depend on details of the stake being offered, valuations and the potential for long term partnerships with Petronas.
ExxonMobil declined to comment, while Shell referred the query to Petronas. A spokeswoman for PTTEP declined to comment on the deal but said the company was keen to invest in Southeast Asia because it had expertise in the region where costs and risks were low.
Gas from the NC3 field in the SK316 block feeds Malaysia's LNG export project, known as LNG 9, Petronas' joint venture with JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp (5020.T) that began commercial production in January.
Petronas could use the funds from the stake sale to develop the Kasawari field in the same block. The field is one of the largest non-associated gas fields in Malaysia and has an estimated recoverable hydrocarbon resource of about three trillion standard cubic feet.
""Kasawari will require a significant capital investment to develop due to the high CO2 content,"" said Prasanth Kakaraparthi, senior upstream research analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
""In a lower-for-longer oil price world, it makes commercial sense for Petronas to farm down its interest and partner with companies that have innovative CO2 handling technology,"" he said.
Petronas put on hold plans to develop the field in 2015 after oil and gas prices fell, according to media reports.

"...Petronas has announced plans to expand its operations in Southeast Asia, focusing on renewable energy and sustainable practices. The state-owned oil and gas company aims to diversify its portfolio amid the global shift towards cleaner energy sources. 

In a recent statement, Petronas CEO Tengku Muhammad Taufik said the company is committed to reducing its carbon footprint and investing in technologies that support a low-carbon future. This includes increasing investments in solar and wind energy projects across the region.

The initiative aligns with Malaysia's broader goals to meet international climate commitments and transition towards a more sustainable economy. Analysts suggest that Petronas' move could position the company as a leader in the energy transition within Southeast Asia, potentially attracting foreign investments and partnerships.

As part of this strategy, Petronas is also exploring collaborations with local governments and private sectors to enhance energy efficiency and promote sustainable practices in the industry.",0.721044659614563,1,1
"Dry conditions plagued Montana this summer, with multiple wildfires torching over 1 million acres throughout the state. The largest fire, the Lodgepole Complex fire, impacted over 270,000 acres. Recent rain and snow, and the forecast for continued precipitation, help to suppress the fires and provide welcome relief for Montana residents.
Fires aren't too uncommon in Montana, but this year's fire season has been different. Spring brought plenty of moisture from an abundant snow-pack and provided adequate moisture for grass growth. The moisture quickly depleting leaving most of the state in drought condition.
""Ranchers saw this as great grass and feed. Firefighters saw it as fuel,"" said Dennis Garcia, Farm Service Agency (FSA) county executive director for Glacier County, Montana. Garcia was activated to serve in the National Guard during the wildfire suppression efforts near Lolo, Montana.
FSA provides assistance to farmers and ranchers who have been impacted by natural disasters, including wildfires, by administering a suite of safety-net programs to help producers recover from eligible losses, such as the Livestock Indemnity Program, the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program, and the Tree Assistance Program. The programs can assist farmers and ranchers who lost livestock, grazing land, fences or eligible trees, bushes and vines as a result of the qualifying natural disaster.
The Lolo Peak Fire, southwest of Lolo, Montana, has impacted over 53,000 acres. The National Guard was activated to help with evacuation efforts near the wildfire.
In addition, the FSA Emergency Conservation Program provides funding and technical assistance for farmers and ranchers to rehabilitate farmland damaged by natural disasters. Low-interest emergency loans are available to help producers recover from production and physical losses. Compensation is also available to producers who purchased coverage through the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, which protects non-insurable crops (including native grass for grazing) against natural disasters that result in lower yields, crop losses or prevented planting.

As a result of the ongoing drought conditions, all Montana counties were approved for emergency haying and grazing of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres. Due to drought and fire conditions, 53 of the state's 56 counties have been declared either primary or contiguous disaster areas.
""The short term impact is FSA can do a lot of good for producers. Producers can get some relief, fix fences and get feed purchased,"" Garcia said.
Garcia said hay donations came into the state from other areas to help out ranchers in need. Additionally, FSA employees from other states, including Missouri and Oklahoma, have spent time helping Montana producers enroll in FSA disaster programs.
""It is proof that the agriculture community is one big small town where you have a lot of folks that have camaraderie,"" he said.

"...has provided some relief, but officials warn that the threat of wildfires remains high as dry weather patterns persist. Firefighters have been working tirelessly to contain the remaining blazes, with many areas still under evacuation orders. The Lodgepole Complex fire, which began in late July, has been particularly challenging due to its rapid spread fueled by strong winds and dry vegetation.

Local communities are coming together to support those affected, with shelters set up for evacuees and donation drives organized to provide essential supplies. The state government has also allocated emergency funds to assist in firefighting efforts and recovery initiatives.

Experts are urging residents to remain vigilant, as the potential for new fires continues with the forecast of above-average temperatures in the coming weeks.

"A Daventry primary school is proposing to close early on a Friday afternoon in order to help its teaching staff maintain a healthy work-life balance.
In a letter to parents, Ashby Fields Primary School announced the start of a public consultation into the idea, the results of which will be published in May.
Headteacher Jacqui Johnson and pupils from Ashby Fields Primary School, pictured in 2015.
Kelly Holmes, whose daughter attends Ashby Fields, said the suggestion did not take into consideration parents in work and argued that spaces at the school's on-site childcare centre - Orchards Wrap Around Care - were limited and cost money.
""What do they intend to do to accommodate working parents?"" said Ms Holmes, who would have to take Friday afternoons off if the proposal is installed.
""They're offering Orchards Wrap Around Care but there's very limited space for that and you have to pay for it.
""They're making working parents pay for extra childcare and we will have to fight it out for places.""
Ashby Fields is proposing to cut two hours from its current 27.5 hours a week timetable. The Department of Education recommends key stage one children receive 21 hours of lessons a week, and 23.5 hours for key stage two.
""Fourteen days our children are going to lose,"" said Ms Holmes.
""What are they going to do in terms of lesson plans? Will the children lose out on education?""
The school explained in the letter that recruiting and retaining high-quality teachers is a national problem that has ""a direct, major impact on not only our children's education, but their well-being and confidence"".
This is being caused by ""the huge workload that ensures teachers work an average of 60 hours a week during term time and through their holidays to keep up"", according to Ashby Fields.
""Many teachers, despite their love of frontline teaching, cannot manage this workload and maintain a healthy work-life balance, and subsequently resign,"" reads the letter.
To help redress this balance and offer teachers more time to develop a curriculum without burning out, Ashby Fields has suggested it closes to children at 1.15pm on a Friday afternoon during term time.
But Ms Holmes doesn't accept the school's reasoning behind the proposal.
""They [teachers] have the school holidays and bank holidays. They get more days off than working parents,"" she said.
A joint statement by the school's chair of governors, Paul Davies, and headteacher Jacqui Johnson states: ""As part of the on-going commitment to continuous school improvement, the senior leadership team and governors of Ashby Fields Primary School have been discussing possible ways to enhance the quality of teaching and learning at the school to ensure we meet with needs of our pupils and invest in our staff.
""One possibility is to review the structure of the school week in relation to an earlier closure time on Friday and as a result access additional staff development time to enhance the quality of teaching and learning.
""As a result, the governors agreed to undertake an informal consultation to gather the opinions of parents before considering any next steps.
""The meeting on Wednesday, April 25 is to enable parents to voice their opinions and provide advice as well as emailing comments to the school.
""Governors are meeting on Thursday to review the feedback from parents and to consider if this option should be further developed as part of a formal proposal for the future.
""Should this proposal be seen as a favourable option then the Local Governing Board will take it to the InMat Trust Board for consideration.""",1.0105726718902588,0,1
"...the headteacher explained that the decision comes after consultations with staff, who expressed the need for additional time to prepare lessons and manage their workload. The proposed change would see students finishing their school day at 1:30 PM every Friday, allowing teachers to use the remaining hours for planning, grading, and professional development.

Parents have been invited to share their thoughts on the proposal, with many expressing support for the initiative. ""It's important for teachers to have time to recharge and prepare,"" said one parent. ""Happy teachers lead to happy students."" 

The school is also considering implementing after-school clubs on Fridays to provide care for students whose parents may need to work later. The headteacher emphasized that the well-being of both students and staff is a priority, and the school is committed to creating an environment that fosters learning and personal growth. A final decision will be made after reviewing feedback from the community.",0.759036123752594,1,1
"Jessica Drake, an adult-film star who claims she refused a $10,000 offer to have sex with Donald Trump after meeting him at a Lake Tahoe golf event in 2006, says Stormy Daniels told her Daniels was threatened by someone to stay silent about Daniels’ alleged sexual tryst with Trump.

Daniels and her attorney recently released a sketch based on Daniels’ recollection of the man they say threatened her in a parking lot in 2011 after she told her story of a 2006 tryst with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament to a tabloid magazine.
In an interview airing on “Good Morning America” on Monday, Drake told ABC News that Daniels, her friend and fellow porn star, is telling the truth.
Michael Avenatti via AP This artist’s drawing released by attorney Michael Avenatti, reports to show the man that the adult film actress Stormy Daniels says threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011 to remain quiet about her affair with President Donald Trump.
“She actually told me about the threat twice,” Drake said. “So the first time she told me about the threat was shortly after it happened. She relayed the experience to me. I said something like, ‘I’m so sorry, I can’t even imagine. What are you going to do?'”
Daniels did not report the alleged threat to authorities.
Drake says that Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, reminded her of the story when Drake came forward with her own allegations of sexual misconduct against Donald Trump at a 2016 news conference.
The Trump campaign issued a statement at the time calling the allegation “totally false and ridiculous.” The campaign added: “Mr. Trump does not know this person, does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her.”
Craig Ruttle/AP Photo Adult film actress Stormy Daniels leaves federal court after speaking to members of the media, April 16, 2018, in New York.
“She goes, ‘Remember what I told you about all those years ago,’” Drake said of her conversation with Daniels. “She goes, ‘Be careful, be really careful. You know, don’t be alone.’”
Trump has denied Daniels’ claim of the affair, but Drake says she was with Daniels during one of her encounters with Trump at the 2006 golf event.
According to Drake, she and Daniels met the future president earlier that day and was later invited to his hotel room a third woman, where Trump allegedly proceeded to kiss them and ask questions.
“Well, we were ushered into the room,” Drake said. “And I remember he was wearing pajamas. And he kissed all of us on the lips and kind of, you know, one of those real close, full-body contact hugs. I do believe 100 percent that he was vetting us to see which one or how many of us he liked.”
The women left, Drake says, but she later received a call inviting her back to the hotel room. When she refused, someone who worked for Trump called her back to offer her $10,000 to return, she claims.
Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Donald Trump steps off Air Force One upon arrival at Palm Beach International in West Palm Beach, Florida, April 18, 2018.
Drake, whose real name is Angela Patrice Heaslet, says she refused again but Daniels, her friend told her later, went back to Trump’s room on her own.
“I relayed my experience to her,” Drake said of Daniels. “Like, what happened with me after we left the room. At the time that I relayed that experience to her, I didn’t yet know of her experience — until she said, ‘He didn’t offer to pay me.’”
Drake said she is speaking up now to back up her friend Daniels, who filed a lawsuit against Trump in March, seeking to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement she signed shortly before the 2016 election.
Drake is named in the agreement as someone with whom Daniels discussed the alleged sexual tryst with Trump.
A payment, worth $130,000, was made by Trump’s longtime attorney Michael Cohen, who is now under criminal investigation. Cohen has said he made the payment personally from his own funds. Trump has said he did not know about the payment by Cohen.

Trump denies having an affair with Daniels.
Meanwhile, Daniels has not mentioned Drake in interviews about the alleged affair — nor did she mention being in Trump’s room with other women. Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avennati, did not comment to ABC News about Drake’s account.
Drake said she is not trying to sell her story and does not intend to sue the president, but her attorney, Gloria Allred, has warned the commander-in-chief to mind what he says -– and tweets -– about her client.
“If he gets enraged and upset and says something about Jessica that is, in fact, defamatory, then we’re gonna need to review our legal options,” Allred said.",1.0,0,1
"...that the encounter left her feeling uncomfortable and pressured. In a recent interview, Drake recounted the details of the meeting, stating that Trump was flirtatious and made suggestive comments. She described how he later approached her with the monetary offer, which she declined, feeling it was inappropriate.

Drake's allegations come amid a broader conversation about the treatment of women in the entertainment industry and the power dynamics at play. She emphasized the importance of speaking out against such behavior, encouraging other women to share their experiences. ""It's crucial for us to stand together and hold powerful figures accountable,"" she said.

The claims have resurfaced as part of ongoing discussions surrounding Trump's past interactions with women, particularly in light of previous allegations made against him. Drake's story adds to the growing list of voices advocating for change and highlighting the need for a more respectful and equitable environment in all industries.",0.7584635615348816,1,1

Susana Mendoza -
Just how much did suburban districts get out of the $429 million that was released to Illinois schools late last week to help with cash flow? Abdon Pallasch, spokesman for Democratic Comptroller Susana Mendoza, gave me a few breakouts.
Millburn Elementary District 24 got $338,731. Indian Prairie District 204 got $5.2 million. Oak Grove Elementary District 68 got $120,632. Kaneland Unit District District 302 got $1.2 million, while Chicago Public Schools received $135 million, she said.
Mendoza's payment was aimed at helping schools after the state missed its first set of regularly scheduled payments for the 2017-18 academic year, which were due Thursday. Those checks are on hold until both chambers of the state legislature act on GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner's veto of a school funding overhaul bill. The Senate overrode Rauner's veto Sunday; the House is expected to convene Wednesday.
The $429 million comes in the form of categorical payments -- funding for special programs such as transportation and bilingual education -- that schools were owed last year. Those payments are part of a massive backlog of unpaid bills that piled up during the two-year budget standoff.
A first
The Democratic Governors Association pointed out that this is the first time in history that Illinois missed its deadline to make school funding payments.

Miley Cyrus has left her fans fuming after she pulled out of her appearance at the Teen Choice Awards in Los Angeles at the last minute.
At the beginning of the awards, Disney favourite Victoria Justice came on the stage to reveal Miley ""couldn't make it"" to the show.

But fans were outraged by Miley's absence and took to Twitter to slam the star.
Meanwhile, other A-list winners including Ed Sheeran and Beyonce also failed to turn up to collect their awards.
But one star who did put in an appearance was Chris Pratt who was seen in public for the first time since announcing his split from wife Anna Faris at the award ceremony.

Their split comes a year after Chris announced he was taking a six month break from acting to focus on Anna and their son Jack.
He told Parade magazine: ""I’ve been on the road for 14 months - I did three movies back to back to back - so I’m taking six months off.""
""I’m taking Jack to Jack’s Beach - which is what we named the little stretch of beach on an island up on the San Juan Islands where we got a place.

"ROME (Reuters) - An Italian man opened fire on African migrants in the central city of Macerata on Saturday, injuring six people before he was captured, in what police said was a racially motivated attack.
The shootings happened just days after a Nigerian migrant was arrested in connection with the death of an 18-year-old Italian woman, whose dismembered body was discovered stuffed into two suitcases near Macerata.
Police named the suspected shooter as Luca Traini, 28, and said he had an Italian flag draped over his shoulders when he was seized in the street by armed police. Onlookers said he made a fascist salute before being handcuffed.
“He drove around in his car and when he saw any black people he shot them,” Marcello Mancini, a Macerata resident, told Reuters television. Police said one of the six victims was seriously hurt and needed surgery, but gave no further details.
Traini also fired shots at the offices of the ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD) in Macerata, but did not injure anyone there. The PD said he had stood as a candidate for the rightist Northern League at local elections last year but had not received any votes.
The League backs fiercely anti-immigrant policies and is part of ex-prime Silvio Berlusconi’s center-right alliance that is leading in the polls ahead of a March 4 national election.
League leader Matteo Salvini distanced himself from the shooting, but blamed mass immigration for the tensions.
“I can’t wait to get into government to restore security, social justice and serenity to Italy,” he told reporters.
PD leader Matteo Renzi called for calm.
“The man who fired the gun, hitting six people of color, is a squalid, mad person. But the state is stronger than him,” he wrote on Facebook.
Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said Italy would come down heavily on anyone promoting violence.

“We will stop this risk. We will stop it immediately. We will stop it together,” he said. “Hatred and violence will not be able to divide us.”
DENIED ASYLUM
Police said the shooter drove around Macerata, which is famed for its outdoor opera festivals, in a black Alfa Romeo car firing out of his window at migrants in various locations.
With police closing in, he left his car in the city center but was almost immediately stopped. Local media said he shouted, “Long live Italy,” as he was taken away.

Tensions in Macerata had risen this week following the gruesome discovery of Pamela Mastropietro’s body. The teenager had run away from a drug rehabilitation center on Monday and met a Nigerian asylum seeker, Innocent Oseghale, the next day.
Her body was found on Wednesday and a preliminary postmortem could not immediately identify the cause of death.
Witnesses said they had earlier seen Oseghale with the suitcases in which the body was found. He refused to talk to the police after his arrest. Newspapers said he was denied asylum last year but had remained in Macerata to appeal against the decision.
“What was this worm still doing in Italy?” Northern League leader Salvini wrote on Facebook at mid-week, accusing the center-left government of responsibility for Mastropietro’s death for allowing migrants to stay in the country.
“The left has blood on its hands,” he wrote.
More than 600,000 mainly African migrants have reached Italy by boat over the past four years, and thousands have perished on the journey. The center-right bloc, which includes the League, says the vast majority have no right to asylum and has promised mass expulsions if it takes power.

"A&M’s first-round draft streak hangs in balance with WR Christian Kirk
Photo: Rodolfo Gonzalez / For The Washington Post Christian Kirk will try to continue a trend of Texas A&M...
COLLEGE STATION — Texas A&M has had at minimum one first-round selection in every NFL draft since 2011. So at least one good thing for the Aggies came out of receiver Christian Kirk bypassing his senior season for the draft — he’s A&M’s best hope of keeping the streak alive.
“I’d be wrong if I said it didn’t mean anything,” Kirk said of perhaps becoming A&M’s 10th first-round choice in the past eight drafts. “It definitely means a lot, to be able to carry on that tradition. And that’s every kid’s dream, to be able to go to college, have a very successful career, be a first-round draft pick and walk across that stage.”
The draft, which starts Thursday night, is being held at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, and Kirk plans to be at home in Arizona. So even if he is a first-round selection, he won’t be walking across a stage to greet NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.
In an odd twist to the 2018 draft, the No. 1 overall selection likely will be in Arlington for a second consecutive year. A year ago A&M’s lone No. 1 overall pick in NFL history, defensive end Myles Garrett, chose to stay in his hometown of Arlington and celebrate his selection with family and friends.

Kirk, praised for his discipline and no-nonsense approach on and off the field, projects as a fringe first-round pick. USA Today this week listed him as the fourth-best receiver in the draft, behind Alabama’s Calvin Ridley, Maryland’s DJ Moore and Memphis’s Anthony Miller. That designation also pushed Kirk out of the first round, with only Ridley and Moore projected in the first.
Watts, Ratley possible picks
A&M safety Armani Watts forecasts as a mid-round choice, and the only other Aggie who might be selected is swift receiver Damion Ratley in the late rounds.
“I’ve been one of the better leaders here these past few years,” Watts said when asked what he will bring to an NFL club. “I just have a drive for football.”
That was evident time and again over his four-year career, as Watts made game-saving interceptions against Arkansas and Tennessee along the way, and multiple clutch plays late in Southeastern Conference contests.
“That really comes with preparation before the game and a lot of film study and good practice habits,” Watts said. “Just knowing where to be at the right time and making the play when it comes.”
The Aggies were especially young last season, with eight starters returning each on offense and defense in 2018. At one point during SEC play, 55 of the 82 players on A&M’s traveling squad were underclassmen (freshmen or sophomores).
A&M’s 2013 and 2014 recruiting classes largely were busts under then-coach Kevin Sumlin, contributing to the Aggies’ low number of potential draft picks. A&M had five players drafted in 2017, three in 2016 and two in 2015. All three of their selections in 2014 were first-round picks.
A&M defensive tackle Zaycoven Henderson was arrested in December on three charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, tampering with evidence and possession of less than two ounces of marijuana.
Henderson was suspended for A&M’s bowl, and as he continues to wait to see what happens with his criminal case, he participated in the NFL combine in February but was not invited to A&M’s annual pro day last month. He went from a possible mid-round selection to perhaps not being drafted at all based on the arrest and the pending status of the criminal case.
A run of talent
Linebacker Von Miller, who has developed into one of the NFL’s top defenders, started the Aggies’ string of first-round picks in 2011. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill, the oft-injured Miami Dolphins starter, followed in 2012, and offensive tackle Luke Joeckel made his mark in 2013.
The following year was especially fruitful for A&M, after offensive tackle Jake Matthews, receiver Mike Evans and quarterback Johnny Manziel all were first-round picks in 2014. Offensive tackle Cedric Ogbuehi followed in 2015, offensive tackle Germain Ifedi squeezed in as the 31st selection (out of 31 first-round picks) two years ago, and Garrett rounded out the nine prime picks in 2017.
Joeckel and Miller were No. 2 overall choices, while Matthews, Evans and Tannehill also went in the top 10 (and with Garrett at No. 1).
The first round of the draft from Arlington is Thursday, while the second round and third rounds are Friday and the fourth through seventh rounds are Saturday.

The wide receiver, known for his explosive speed and precise route-running, has been a standout performer for the Aggies, showcasing his skills in crucial games throughout the season. Kirk's ability to stretch the field and make contested catches has drawn the attention of NFL scouts, who are eager to see if he can elevate his game at the professional level.

Texas A&M has a rich history of sending players to the NFL, and Kirk aims to keep that legacy alive. With the draft approaching, he has been working diligently to improve his performance, participating in training camps and showcasing his talents in front of league executives. As the Aggies look to build on their recent successes, Kirk's potential selection in the first round could serve as a significant milestone for the program, further solidifying its reputation as a breeding ground for elite football talent.",0.7412378787994385,1,1
"GETTY Families and friends have been urged to do more to reduce the risk of elderly people being neglected
Around 500,000 UK pensioners are faced with violence or coercion each year, but cases can be hard to spot. As well as physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect, financial abuse can also have a significant adverse impact on victims’ health and wellbeing. And greater awareness of the problem - including scam mail targeting and doorstep conmen – is needed to reduce the risk of older and disabled people being mistreated.
Research also shows that 53 per cent of older people believe they have been targeted by fraudsters and that a third of older people who responded to a scam may have lost £1,000 or more. Older people defrauded in their homes are two-and-a-half times more likely to enter residential care within two years, compared to older people who are not victims of fraud. Fraudsters, including bogus doorstep callers and scam mail firms, often target older people whose health can suffer after falling victim to a scam, leading to extra costs on the health and social care sector, which could be prevented through earlier prevention and protection.
The rights of older and disabled people need to be protected Glen Garrod, Vice President of ADASS
The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services is calling for people to do more to look out for signs of abuse and to listen properly and act on any concerns. ADASS is also calling for a Government-funded recruitment campaign to help address high staff turnover and a reliance on agency staff, which leads to lack of continuity and to carers not knowing the person they are looking after. Training of carers and healthcare professional dealing with pensioners so they recognise signs of elder abuse should also be compulsory.

Glen Garrod, Vice President of ADASS, said: “Safeguarding adults at risk of abuse or neglect is one of the most important things that Social Services and their partners do and is a top priority at ADASS. “The rights of older and disabled people need to be protected just as much as those of children, particularly when they are less physically and emotionally strong and able to free themselves of abuse.
GETTY Social care experts have called for more to be done to protect vulnerable elderly people
“Carers, families and neighbours need to be more aware of abuse, which can see older and disabled people lose their life savings and suffer deteriorating health after falling victim to scam letters and phone calls and doorstep fraudsters. “We all need to listen to and understand the concerns of people receiving care, and not be afraid to act on them or merely dismiss them based on stereotypical assumptions of old age or dementia.” One case featured in the report was of a 92-year-old woman living alone who was duped into paying around £60,000 over 10 years - £500 a month - on bogus prize draws, with the equivalent of 34 bags of scam mail found at her home.

"...year, according to a new report highlighting the alarming prevalence of elder abuse. The study reveals that many elderly individuals suffer in silence, often due to fear of retaliation or a lack of support from their families. Experts are calling for increased awareness and proactive measures to protect vulnerable seniors.

Charities and advocacy groups are urging families to maintain regular contact with elderly relatives, ensuring they feel safe and valued. Simple actions, such as frequent phone calls or visits, can help identify signs of distress or abuse early on. 

Additionally, the report emphasizes the importance of community involvement, encouraging neighbors to look out for one another. Local authorities are also being urged to provide better resources and training for caregivers to recognize and address potential abuse. With the aging population on the rise, addressing these issues is more critical than ever to ensure the dignity and safety of older adults in society.",0.7205982208251953,1,1
"Visiting the hairdressers is stressful enough so you can spare a thought for this teen who was forced to confront a combination of her biggest fears. The 16 year old has been suffering with severe depression for a few years, not being able to face brushing her hair and only getting up to go to the toilet. When she visited a salon her hair was a matted mass and she thought the only option was to shave it all off rather than face the pain of untangling it but her hairdresser had a better idea.
When you're feeling low, how you look is the last thing on your mind and anyone who's ever experienced depression can sympathise with this Iowa teenager. The 16 year old had been suffering with severe depression when she visited her local hair salon in Waterloo, Iowa, ahead of her dreaded school portrait. Having not being able to face brushing her hair for a prolonged period of time, it'd grown into a matted mass and she asked for it be shaved off as the ordeal of untangling it was understandably too much to bear.
But the salon had other ideas with the girl's assigned stylist Kayley Olson refusing to shear off the lengths. The 20-year-old student hairdresser recalled the tale, which she branded ""one of the hardest experiences"", in a moving Facebook post last week which has since been shared over 75K times, at the time of writing.
Instead of chopping off the teenager's locks, Kayley took it upon herself to transform her look and give her back some of her self-worth and self-confidence which she'd lost to depression. She wrote: ""When she walked in she told us just cut it all off I can't deal with the pain of combing it out, she called herself worthless for it. It honestly broke my heart and we tried everything we could to keep this child's hair for her!""
The girl - who Kayley wants to keep anonymous - confessed to the stylist that she felt so worthless, she couldn't be bothered to brush her hair which struck a chord with her. Rather than simply cut off the matted mass, Kayley selflessly spent 13 hours, over two days, untangling it before restyling her new shoulder-length haircut.
Loading...
She added: ""At the end of the day I want this to be a lesson to people. MENTAL HEALTH is a thing, it effects people all around the world and of all ages! PARENTS take it serious don't just push your kids off and tell them to get over something they legitimately can't.
""A CHILD should NEVER feel so worthless to not even want to brush their hair. After being here 8 hours yesterday and 5 hours today we finally made this beautiful girl smile and feel like she IS worth something!""
Kayley was delighted to share that her client was pleased with the finished result, so much so, she told her: ""I will actually smile for my school's pictures today, you made me feel like me again.""
Kayley's experience resonated with Facebook users with many sharing their own similar experiences in the comments while many others heaped praise on her for the selfless act. One wrote: ""When my Mom was ill, I went through something similar. It felt selfish to take care of myself when she was dying. Thank you for being there for this young lady, when she needed help. I hope that you both have all the love, happiness and success that your hearts & hands can hold!""
Another added: ""You may have just saved a life...being a teenager is tough enough but you are very special to have recognized there were other issues going on and cared enough to help change it.""

"...was not only getting her hair cut for the first time but also had to do so while facing her fear of clowns. As she sat in the salon chair, the stylist, who was dressed as a clown for a charity event, approached her with a bright smile and colorful wig. The teen's heart raced as she tried to calm herself, reminding herself that it was just a costume.

Despite her initial panic, the stylist's friendly demeanor helped ease her anxiety. With each snip of the scissors, the teen found herself laughing at the clown's silly antics and exaggerated expressions. By the end of the appointment, she not only left with a fresh haircut but also a newfound sense of bravery. The experience taught her that sometimes, facing your fears can lead to unexpected joy.

"In my world, Burbank is still the home of the Lockheed Aviation Company.
The firm was at one time a competitor with Boeing, Douglas, de Havilland, Vickers and many other companies worldwide for sales of airliners to the airline industry. But time, as I know only too well, marches relentlessly on; and the last Lockheed product which I flew in was an L1011 Tristar many years ago. In 1995, Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta to form Lockheed Martin, which is now a worldwide developer and builder of advanced military and space vehicles.
Lockheed Martin still has a facility in Burbank, which is a city of upwards of 100 000 residents in Los Angeles County in Southern California, 12 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. And younger people than I might already know that, because of its proximity to Hollywood, Burbank is home to companies such as the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), the Walt Disney Company and Warner Brothers, a circumstance which has earned the city the unofficial title ‘Media Capital of the World.’
The city of Burbank was named after a certain David Burbank, an entrepreneur who established a sheep ranch there in 1867. And what brought all of this into my mind was a series of associations which started with an entirely different American gentleman, a horticulturist who rejoiced in the name Luther Burbank; and Luther Burbank has his name … usually in pretty small print admittedly ... in horticultural handbooks because, in 1890, he cross-bred Leucanthemum vulgare … a name derived from two Greek words and one Latin one, meaning ‘the common white flower’ … with Leucanthemum maximum … ‘the biggest white flower’ … and cross-bred this hybrid plant with Leucanthemum lacustre … ‘the outstanding white flower’. The resulting Leucanthemum triple hybrid was then cross-bred with Nipponanthemum nipponicum … ‘the Japanese daisy’ … to produce a plant called Leucanthemum superbum … the superb white flower’ …which gardeners are most likely to recognise under its common name – Shasta daisy. (When dogs are allowed to cross-breed in a similar way, we call the resulting puppies ‘mongrels’: but when plant breeders cross different species we call the mongrel plants ‘hybrids’ and treat them as thoroughbreds.)
The Shasta daisy was named after Mount Shasta, a 14 000-plus foot non-active volcano at the southern end of the Cascade Range in Siskiyou County in California. Mount Shasta is high enough to have a snow-capped peak for most of the year, even in southern California; and the petals of the Shasta daisy are the colour of clean snow in the sunshine – a very bright white. With its bright yellow centre surrounded by bright, white petals, the Shasta daisy looks like, well, a very large daisy; and if you can recognise a daisy, you’ll recognise a Shasta daisy when you see one. It is perennial … it will live for many years … in favourable conditions and is a favourite with gardeners worldwide, although some people find the scent of certain varieties quite unpleasant.
An undemanding plant, it is very happy in Scotland, which is not surprising when one knows that one of its grandparents … Leucanthemum vulgare … is better known by its common name of ox-eye daisy and grows wild throughout the British Isles and much of western Europe. Indeed, Shasta daisies are also happy to grow wild in Britain where they have ‘escaped’ from gardens. (I like the term ‘garden escapees’.) And yes, gentle reader, if you are wondering, my wife and I do have Shasta daisies in our own garden; and ox-eye daisies which ‘escaped’ from our garden thrive in the railway cutting behind our house.",1.0151007175445557,0,1
"...aviation giants. Founded in the 1920s, Lockheed played a pivotal role in the development of military and commercial aircraft, contributing significantly to the aerospace industry. The company’s iconic designs, such as the P-38 Lightning and the Constellation, not only showcased engineering prowess but also set benchmarks for performance and innovation.

As the Cold War intensified, Lockheed became synonymous with advanced military technology, producing aircraft like the U-2 and the SR-71 Blackbird, which pushed the boundaries of speed and altitude. However, the company faced challenges in the 1970s and 1980s, including financial difficulties and scandals that led to a restructuring.

Today, while Lockheed Martin has evolved into a global leader in defense and aerospace, the legacy of its Burbank roots remains a point of pride for the community. The city continues to celebrate its aviation heritage, with museums and events that honor the contributions of Lockheed and its impact on the industry.",0.6437036991119385,1,1

Sunrisers Hyderabad has also tweeted from their official account that medium pacer Billy Stanlake has been ruled out of the entire tournament with fractured finger.
Billy Stanlake has been ruled out of the remainder of IPL 2018 owing to a fractured finger. The #OrangeArmy wishes him a speedy recovery. — SunRisers Hyderabad (@SunRisers) April 24, 2018
Preview
Sunrisers have slipped from a comfortable three-match winning start, suffering back-to-back defeats to Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) respectively, and would be keen to bounce back.
Defending champions Mumbai, on the other hand, have a tough task to rediscover themselves after slumping to their fourth loss in five games.
Mumbai had started their campaign with three losses on the trot before registering their first win over Royal Challengers Bangalore, but the three-wicket defeat to Rajasthan Royals on Sunday has once again put them under tremendous pressure.
With nine games left before the play-off stage, Mumbai find themselves in a tight situation to win at least seven of them to improve their chances. As such, a win over SRH on Tuesday is imperative to keep them in the hunt.
Barring local boy Suryakumar Yadav's heroics with the willow, Mumbai have very little to boast of this season, with the other batsmen yet to deliver.
Yadav has had a consistent run of good scores in the opening slot, leaving him four short of reaching the 200 mark for the season, while skipper Rohit Sharma struck one match-winning knock of 94 against RCB.
Mumbai's biggest misery in batting has been the repeated failures of West Indian Keiron Pollard and his compatriot Evin Lewis, at the top while the all-rounder duo of Pandya brothers -- Hardik and Krunal -- have also failed to impress with the bat this season.
In the bowling department, the pace duo of Jasprit Bumrah and Mustafizur Rahman have been right on the money while Mitchell McClenaghan has got among the wickets despite finishing with a higher economy rate. The Pandya siblings have done a decent job with the ball.
Meanwhile, despite a three-match winning streak, Sunrisers find themselves at the lower half of the IPL table, thanks to the successive defeats to Kings XI and CSK.
While captain Kane Williamson has been in superb form, carrying the batting on his shoulders to amass 230 runs in five games, the other batsmen, including opener Shikhar Dhawan, have not given him adequate support.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha has been particularly below par with a tally of just 62 runs and may soon make way for Shreevats Goswami.
Among other batsmen, Yusuf Pathan showed glimpses of his old attacking self against Rajasthan with a quick 27-ball 45, but still lacks consistency.
The bowling unit looks formidable with Bhuvneshwar Kumar leading the pack in the company of youngsters Siddarth Kaul, Billy Stanlake and T.Natarajan.
Afghan leg-spinner Rashid Khan along with Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan will aim to contain the fancied Mumbai line-up in the middle overs.
Teams:
Sunrisers Hyderabad: Kane Williamson (Captain), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Shikhar Dhawan, Shakib Al Hasan, Manish Pandey, Carlos Brathwaite, Yusuf Pathan, Wriddhiman Saha, Rashid Khan, Ricky Bhui, Deepak Hooda, Siddarth Kaul, T.Natarajan, Mohammad Nabi, Basil Thampi, K Khaleel Ahmed, Sandeep Sharma, Sachin Baby, Chris Jordan, Billy Stanlake, Tanmay Agarwal, Shreevats Goswami, Bipul Sharma, Mehdi Hasan, Alex Hales.

On the bowling front, Jasprit Bumrah remains a key player, known for his death-over expertise, while Mustafizur Rahman adds variety with his left-arm pace. The team management is hopeful that Mitchell McClenaghan can provide early breakthroughs to put pressure on the opposition.

In contrast, their rivals, the Chennai Super Kings, have been in formidable form, making this clash a highly anticipated encounter. Fans are eager to see if the Mumbai Indians can turn their fortunes around and secure a vital win in the tournament.",0.7980406880378723,1,1
"Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said Russia and China are pursuing entirely new nuclear capabilities tailored to achieve particular national security objectives while also modernising its conventional military, challenging traditional US military superiority. (Photo: AP) Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said Russia and China are pursuing entirely new nuclear capabilities tailored to achieve particular national security objectives while also modernising its conventional military, challenging traditional US military superiority. (Photo: AP)
The Trump administration has announced a new policy to modernise its nuclear arsenal by developing new smaller atomic bombs and enhancing its deterrence capabilities. The strategy, President Donald Trump said, is tailored and flexible to address the wide array of threats in the 21st century. “It pursues modernisation of our nuclear command, control, and communications, all three legs of our triad, our dual capable aircraft, and our nuclear infrastructure,” said Trump after the the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) was out at the Pentagon.
The strategy develops capabilities aimed at making use of nuclear weapons less likely, he said, adding that it enhances deterrence of strategic attacks against the US, its allies and partners, that may not come in the form of nuclear weapons. “And, importantly, it reaffirms our commitment to arms control and nuclear non-proliferation, maintains the moratorium on nuclear testing, and commits to improving efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to nuclear terrorism,” Trump said.
In his preface to the new policy, that runs into 100 pages, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said maintaining an effective nuclear deterrent is much less expensive than fighting a war that the US was unable to deter. “While we will be relentless in ensuring our nuclear capabilities are effective, the US is not turning away from its long-held arms control, non-proliferation, and nuclear security objectives,” Mattis said.
“Our commitment to the goals of the treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) remains strong,” he said. Mattis said Russia and China are pursuing entirely new nuclear capabilities tailored to achieve particular national security objectives while also modernising its conventional military, challenging traditional US military superiority. Russia, Mattis said, is modernising these weapons as well as its other strategic systems.
“Even more troubling has been Russia’s adoption of military strategies and capabilities that rely on nuclear escalation for their success,” said Mattis.
“These developments, coupled with Russia’s seizure of Crimea and nuclear threats against our allies, mark Moscow’s decided return to Great Power competition,” he said. North Korea and Iran are the other two countries that figure in the report. There is no mention of Pakistan in the report, even as senior US officials in the past have expressed concerns over the security of nuclear weapons in the South Asian country.
“Expanding flexible US nuclear options now, to include low-yield options, is important for the preservation of credible deterrence against regional aggression,” said the report as released by the Pentagon.
“It will raise the nuclear threshold and help ensure that potential adversaries perceive no possible advantage in limited nuclear escalation, making nuclear employment less likely,” the report said. The US will maintain, and enhance as necessary, the capability to forward deploy nuclear bombers and dual capability aircraft (DCA) around the world, it said.
Additionally, in the near-term, the US will modify a small number of existing SLBM warheads to provide a low-yield option, and in the longer term, pursue a modern nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM), the report said. For the longer term, the US will pursue a nuclear-armed SLCM, leveraging existing technologies to help ensure its cost effectiveness, according to the report.
“SLCM will provide a needed non-strategic regional presence, an assured response capability. It also will provide an arms control compliant response to Russia’s non-compliance with the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, its non-strategic nuclear arsenal, and its other destabilising behaviours,” the report said. The Nuclear report also said the US will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the NPT and in compliance with their nuclear nonproliferation obligations.
Following the release of the report, US Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said the NPR makes sure the US remains flexible and well prepared for the unique threats it faces today. “We want to see a world that is free of nuclear weapons, but our nuclear policy needs to be rooted in the reality of the world we live in, where aggressive regimes like North Korea threaten us and our allies with their pursuit of illegal nuclear and ballistic weapons,” said Haley.
“While we have continued to reduce the size of our nuclear arsenal, countries like Russia and China have moved in the opposite direction. The NPR appropriately addresses the nature of these threats and ensures that the safety and security of the American people remain our top priority,” she said.
In a special briefing with reporters at the Pentagon, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Tom Shannon, said that in addition to China and Russia, other “unfriendly regimes and enemies of the US put lives at risk by pursuing nuclear weapons”.
“North Korea continues its illicit nuclear weapons programme and missile capabilities. Iran retains the technological capability to develop a nuclear weapon within one year of deciding to do so,” Shannon said. He said that nuclear terrorism is still a major threat in the 21st century and countries need to work to mitigate it.
“The potential threat of non-state actors getting their hands on a nuclear weapon remains at the front of all of our minds,” Shannon said.
“Because of the dangerous world we live in and our unwavering commitment to our allies, the 2018 NPR focuses on strengthening extended deterrence,” he said. The US has formal extended deterrence commitments that assure European, Asian and Pacific allies of its commitment to use nuclear force to protect them, if necessary.
Ongoing, close collaboration with allies and partners is essential to deterring or defeating the common threats they face, said Shannon, noting that this collaboration includes sustained dialogues and joint military exercises.
“But we also realise that every ally and partner faces a different threat environment. We will continue to work with them to tailor our assurance strategies in ways that are most effective for their specific situation,” he said. Shannon said the US remains committed to the allies under its nuclear umbrella. “Our extended deterrence commitments are unwavering. We have the ability and will to fulfil them. Potential adversaries should not doubt our resolve,” Shannon said.

"...military dominance. In a statement to Congress, Mattis emphasized that both nations are investing heavily in advanced technologies, including hypersonic weapons and cyber capabilities, which could undermine the effectiveness of U.S. deterrence strategies. He noted that Russia's development of new missile systems and China's expansion of its naval forces are particularly concerning, as they could shift the balance of power in key regions.

Mattis called for a comprehensive review of U.S. defense strategies to address these emerging threats, advocating for increased funding for research and development in cutting-edge military technologies. He also highlighted the importance of strengthening alliances with NATO and other partners to counteract the growing influence of these adversaries.

"The five English clubs who created history by qualifying for the Champions League knockout stages will learn their fate when the draw for the last 16 is held in Nyon, Switzerland, this morning.
Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea all qualified from their respective groups, making England the first country to have five teams in the competition's last 16.
Chelsea face a daunting tie, with Paris St Germain, Barcelona and Besiktas their only possible opponents when the draw is made at UEFA's headquarters at 11am GMT.
The Blues finished second behind Roma in their group and along with the Serie A side, they are also ineligible to face their Premier League rivals.
The two Manchester clubs, Liverpool and Tottenham all finished top of their groups, meaning Chelsea can only be paired with either the French or Turkish champions, or the current LaLiga leaders.
Chelsea did not qualify for last season's Champions League but their interest in the competition was ended by PSG in the previous two editions, although they eliminated Barca en route to the 2012 title in the last meeting between the teams.
For the four remaining English clubs, five-time champions Bayern Munich and last year's runners-up Juventus are stand-out dangers, while reigning champions Real Madrid are potential foes for United, City and Liverpool.
Tottenham surprisingly finished ahead of the 12-time champions in the group en route to qualifying for the knockout stages for only the third time in their history, meaning they avoid Zinedine Zidane's men for the time being.
Real defeated United in the European Super Cup earlier this year and have knocked the Red Devils out of the Champions League on three occasions since the turn of the century.
Liverpool overcame Real in the 1981 European Cup final and memorably defeated them 5-0 on aggregate in the last 16 eight years ago. City are winless in their four meetings with Spain's capital club in the last five years.
Basel, runners-up to United, Sevilla, second in their group to Liverpool, Shakhtar Donetsk, who qualified alongside City in their pool, and Porto will be viewed as kinder draws.
PSG - bolstered by an enviable attacking trio of Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe - are currently favourites with bookmakers to go all the way in the Champions League for the first time.
They could be paired alongside Real - third favourites behind Manchester City - in what would be indisputably the tie of the round.
The draw for the last 32 of the Europa League will be conducted an hour later, and Arsenal, the only remaining English team in the competition, could face Scottish champions Celtic.
Arsene Wenger's men will be seeded after finishing as one of 12 group winners and will therefore avoid the likes of AC Milan, Villarreal and Zenit St Petersburg.
They will also be kept away from CSKA Moscow, Atletico Madrid, RB Leipzig and Sporting Lisbon, the four best third-placed teams in the Champions League group stages.
Because Celtic won only won one Champions League game, they join Napoli, Spartak Moscow and Borussia Dortmund as the unseeded teams.

"FOMULA ONE: Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel sensationally escaped from the clutches of Mercedes’s Valtteri Bottas in a thrilling final-laps chase for victory at the 2018 Bahrain Grand Prix.
Monday 9 April 2018, 12:06PM

The German started from pole but was forced to switch to a one-stop strategy late in the race, requiring him to preserve his tyres against Bottas’s fresher rubber.
But Vettel, racing in his 200th grand prix, used every ounce of his experience to fend off the quick-finishing Finn.
“I tell you, these tyres were done!” Vettel shouted over team radio on the cool-down lap. “They were done for the last 10 laps!
“Grazie, ragazzi, mamma mia!”
The strategic showdown between Ferrari and Mercedes was foreshadowed on Saturday (Apr 7), but Red Bull Racing was expected to figure strongly in race permutations; however, both Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen were eliminated from the race in the opening laps.
Ricciardo’s car switched itself off on lap two with an electrical issue, whereas Verstappen picked up a puncture in a tangle with Hamilton on the opening lap.
Though the Dutchman limped back to the pits for a tyre change, he sustained too much damage to his car in the process, and his team ordered his retirement on lap five.
Hamilton had lost a place to Fernando Alonso at the start, but a skirmish with the Spaniard and Nico Hulkenberg and Esteban Ocon on lap four put the Briton up to sixth, and decisive passes on Magnussen and Gasly on laps five and eight put the reigning world champion into fourth place.
At this stage the Briton was in the fight for victory with a potential tyre advantage, having started the race on the more enduring soft compound compared the supersoft used by the Vettel, Bottas and Kimi Raikkonen ahead.
Ferrari committed race leader Vettel and third-paced Raikkonen to two-stop races by pitting them for the soft-compound tyres on laps 18 and 19 respectively, prompting Mercedes to opt for the alternative one-stop strategy.
Bottas was the first silver car to pit, switching straight to the medium-compound tyre on lap 20.
The Ferrari drivers were required to push for the rest of the race to counter Mercedes’s long-game approach, and Vettel duly obliged. By lap 27 he had re-passed Hamilton, who had inherited the lead, which prompted the Briton to make his sole pit stop for the medium compound.
The order resumed, with Vettel leading from Bottas, Raikkonen and Hamilton, and with 24 seconds required to make a pit stop, Mercedes ensured Lewis kept himself within 20 seconds of Sebastian at the head of the field.
The tension between the two opposing strategies escalated through to lap 35, when Ferrari blinked and stopped Raikkonen in an attempted to force Bottas to follow him, but the ploy backfired when the Finn left his pit box before his stop was completed, hitting a mechanic in the process.
Ferrari was forced to retire the car, losing a key strategic tool in the process.
Vettel was told he was being moved to strategy B, which meant he wouldn’t be stopping again. The German switched to conservation mode to eke out the maximum life from his soft compound tyres.
Bottas seized his moment to strike. He began reeling in the scarlet car, and as Vettel’s tyres began to expire in the final 10 laps, the Mercedes’s rate of progress increased to a second a lap.
With five laps remaining little more than two seconds separated the race protagonists, and on the penultimate lap Bottas got within DRS range, closing in close enough to have a look down the inside at turn one.
Vettel, however, deftly fended off his advances, saving his battery power for deployment at key traction moments to counteract Bottas’s superior grip.
The German led the Finn over the line by just 0.699 seconds.
“I think I came on the radio with 10 laps to go and said, ‘I have everything under control’,” he said. “But that was a lie, I admit! Nothing was under control!
“I was making the maths inside the car – ’10 laps to go with that pace; he’s going to catch me!’
“He had a bit of a sniff, but fortunately he ran out of laps.
“That I managed to get the win under these conditions, it tastes even better, so I’m very happy.”
Bottas was disappointed to let victory elude him, but it was nonetheless an important result for the Finn after a messy first round in Melbourne to open the final season on his current Mercedes contract.
“I was trying to get every lap perfect trying to catch him, but it wasn’t quite enough,” Bottas said.
“Being second with such a close margin and with such big pace in the end is for sure disappointing, but we’ll try to get the, next time.”
Hamilton finished a frustrated third, his race troubled by radio issues that he felt prevented him from running his optimum race, though he acknowledged a podium finish was a good result give his grid position.
“I started ninth, so third is not so bad at all. It’s damage limitation,” he said.
Pierre Gasly finished a superb fourth after starting a similarly impressive fifth on the grid for Toro Rosso-Honda.
The Frenchman was perhaps the driver of the day, executing a mature performance that belied his seven-race Formula One career.
Moreover, it was Honda’s best result since its return to the sport as an engine manufacturer with McLaren in 2015.
Kevin Magnussen finished fifth for Haas, making good on the team’s promising form in Australia, where it failed to score points after two crucial pit-stop errors.
Renault’s Nico Hulkenberg spent the race keeping a ferocious Fernando Alonso at bay, the Spaniard nonetheless salvaging points for McLaren after a hitherto disappointing weekend.
Alonso’s teammate, Stoffel Vandoorne, finished 10 seconds adrift from the lead McLaren.
Marcus Ericsson pulled off a strong one-stop race to finish ninth, scoring two points for Sauber – the team’s first since last year’s Azerbaijan Grand Prix and Swede’s first points since 2015.
Esteban Ocon rounded out the top 10, scoring Force India’s first point of the season.",0.9929947257041931,0,1
"...Vettel, who started from pole position, faced intense pressure from Bottas in the closing stages of the race. The Finnish driver, who had been gaining ground after a late pit stop, pushed hard to close the gap, but Vettel's experience and skill behind the wheel proved decisive. 

As the two cars raced side by side through the final corners, the tension in the air was palpable. Fans held their breath as Vettel expertly navigated the track, maintaining his lead by a mere few tenths of a second. The roar of the crowd reached a fever pitch as they witnessed the fierce battle unfold.

In the end, Vettel crossed the finish line just ahead of Bottas, securing a crucial victory for Ferrari in the early stages of the season. The win not only boosted Vettel's confidence but also reaffirmed Ferrari's competitive edge against their long-time rivals, Mercedes, setting the stage for an exhilarating championship battle ahead.",0.7186081409454346,1,1

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California lawmakers on Tuesday revived a long-stalled proposal to set a goal of generating 100 percent of the state's energy from carbon-free sources.
With other controversial and high-stakes energy legislation also moving forward, California lawmakers face an array of decisions with vast implications for the Western energy grid, the future of renewable power and consumers' electric bills.
A state legislative committee sent the 100 percent clean energy bill to the full Assembly, setting up a vote later this year.
The bill's revival is a tentative victory for its author, Democratic Sen. Kevin de Leon, who is waging an uphill battle to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein in the November election.
De Leon fought aggressively to push the bill forward in the final days of last year's legislative session but was unsuccessful.
The bill would bump up California's energy mandate, known as the renewable portfolio standard, from 50 percent to 60 percent by 2030. That energy would have to come from specific renewable resources including wind, solar, geothermal and small dams.
It would then set a goal of getting all remaining energy from resources that don't produce climate changing gases by 2045, leaving details of the plan to be hashed out later.
""This will put us on the pathway to clean renewable energy and economic growth for the future of California,"" de Leon said.
Critics include business interests and utilities, which warn that industrial power users, like factories and food processors, and consumers will be left paying higher prices. They worry that the bill would prematurely make fossil fuel plants obsolete, rendering them stranded assets that don't generate revenue but still must be paid off by ratepayers.
""Not now,"" said Assemblyman Jim Patterson, a Republican from Fresno. ""This is a leap of faith and a gamble.""
The action came as the Senate also considers legislation to turn California's energy grid manager, the Independent System Operator, into a regional entity open to utilities across the West, and as Gov. Jerry Brown and legislative leaders consider making it easier for utilities to reduce liability for wildfire damage. The issues could get linked in negotiations.",0.953279435634613,0,1
"California lawmakers have reintroduced a bill aimed at achieving 100-percent carbon-free energy by 2045, reigniting discussions on the state's ambitious climate goals. The legislation, which had previously faced hurdles, seeks to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Proponents argue that this move is essential for combating climate change and ensuring a sustainable future for the state.

The bill outlines a comprehensive framework for increasing renewable energy production while phasing out reliance on natural gas and other carbon-emitting sources. Supporters, including environmental groups and clean energy advocates, emphasize the economic benefits of green jobs and the potential for California to lead the nation in climate policy. However, critics express concerns about the feasibility of such a rapid transition and the potential impact on energy prices. As the legislative session progresses, the bill's fate will depend on negotiations and the political landscape surrounding climate initiatives in the state.",0.7550444006919861,1,1
"Finally, the die is cast.
The Vice President of the Ghana Football Association has been relieved of his duties following an Executive Committee meeting held on Tuesday.
It’s interesting that the decision has come now, weeks after Afriyie announced at his 50th birthday party that he intended to contest in the 2019 GFA polls.
In the intervening period, the media waited for the blessing of Kwesi Nyantakyi for his vice. It never came. Instead, a loud silence filled the void, highlighting the rumoured rift between the two.
This rift, which had started months before when Afriyie had described Nyantakyi as greedy following disagreements over financial matters, has ultimately proven to have grown into Tuesday’s announcement.
Last year, Nyantakyi had also mentioned at one meeting, at least, that he wanted his deputy out because he suspected Afriyie of conniving with Nii Lante Vanderpuije, an avowed critic of the GFA boss.
But what will be the domino effect of Afriyie’s sacking?
Battle lines drawn
Before now, the line in the sand between the two men had been blurred. Now it’s not, and both know where there are on the political divide. Without a doubt, Afriyie will now be emboldened to go all out in his quest to wrestle power from the GFA boss.
Even though Afriyie has denied on several occasions that he was at loggerheads with Nyantakyi, the former’s sacking has simply validated that rumour. This will pave way for the 50 year-old George, whose campaign team had already told Joy Sports that his plans for the future of Ghana football are ready.
But history is not on his side.
Fred Pappoe (sidelined in 2011), and Fred Crentsil (sidelined in 2015) are the two previous Vice Presidents who suddenly found themselves out of the position, and their subsequent career trajectories say a lot about Nyantakyi: he does not allow his former lieutenants to continue being influential in football circles.
But George has never been deterred by this, as he told Joy Sports following his announcement to contest.
“I think after serving on the Executive Committee for three terms and the role I have played in this current tenure, I have gained the experience needed as well as gone through the mill to and learnt enough to place me in a position to take over from my boss.”
“Irrespective of the numerous criticisms, I believe this administration under Nyantakyi has achieved a lot and I don’t think anyone is better placed to continue and build on the achievement than my good self,” he said at the time.
Clearly, he was not singing from the same hymn sheet as his boss.
Relationship at the Executive Committee level
The Executive Committee (ExCo) is the second most powerful decision making body of the Football Association, after the Emergency Committee.
And since Nyantakyi announced he will not seek re-election several times within the last year, some names have popped up as possible contenders. None of those names were as high-profile as Afriyie.
This resulted in quiet division amongst the Exco – with some pandering towards him, while others felt Nyantakyi was still the right man for the job.
This toxic atmosphere at the helm of power needed to be fumigated. Trust Nyantakyi to deal with it, and he started doing so two weeks ago, when the FA announced that Afriyie had been removed as head of the Black Stars Management Committee. This position was one Afriyie had held since 2014, as a reward for his loyalty to Nyantakyi.
His removal was a clear signal that his end was near, and he knew. Last month, Afriyie told Kumasi-based Oyerepa FM that he was ready “to leave this position…because it is not for my mother or my father’s lineage. Position is not possession.”
If anyone was in doubt about the internal disquiet, some of Afriyie’s own colleagues on the Exco publicly shamed him. These included Western Regional Football Association chairman Kojo Yankah, and Winfred Osei, who has now (conveniently) taken Afriyie’s place at head of the Black Stars Management Committee.
“There is nobody in the country that has more experience in football administration in Ghana than Kwesi Nyantakyi. He is the CAF Vice President and FIFA Council member,” Osei said, effectively throwing Afriyie under the bus.
It is now clear that the relationships within the Executive Committee are frayed.
Nyantakyi will seek re-election in 2019?
The big picture of all this politicking has been because nobody is sure if Nyantakyi will go for his fourth term.
The experienced administrator has been at the helm since late 2005. Despite three straight qualifications to the World Cup, football in Ghana has not been at all rosy. Of particular has been the alarming decline in the Ghana Premier League by all stakeholders, and the death of the FA Cup for many years – until its revival some seven years ago.
Though Nyantakyi himself maintains the league is one of the best organised on the continent, the calls for change have always come from the general public, and not the so-called ‘football people’.
However, the sacking of his vice has finally emboldened opinions that to save his legacy, Nyantakyi will have to seek re-election. For the first time since 2005, the existence of enemies rallying for his downfall is a clear and present danger.
But Nyantakyi did not get this far by chance. He knows the game. He’s played it since his mid-twenties, and he will not be easy to uproot.
As George Afriyie himself said about why he wanted the top job after denying it for years, “only a fool doesn’t change his mind”.
We wait and see.",0.9576399326324463,0,1
"...the decision comes amid growing concerns over the management of the national football team and the recent underwhelming performances in international competitions. Sources within the association indicate that the Vice President's approach to team selection and player management faced significant criticism from both fans and stakeholders.

The Executive Committee, which convened to address these pressing issues, unanimously agreed that a change in leadership was necessary to restore confidence in the association. In a statement released shortly after the meeting, the Ghana Football Association emphasized its commitment to improving the standards of football in the country and ensuring that the national team is competitive on the global stage.

As the search for a new Vice President begins, many are speculating about potential candidates who could bring fresh ideas and a renewed vision for Ghanaian football. The association is expected to announce interim leadership soon, as it prepares for upcoming qualifiers and tournaments.",0.720079779624939,1,1
"‘Time to build mega sports complex in Abbottabad’
KARACHI: Pakistan Volleyball Federation’s (PVF) Chairman Chaudhry Mohammad Yaqoob on Wednesday said that the federal government should establish a well-facilitated Sports Complex at Abbottabad so that national camps could be held there in summer in future.
“You know national athletes will have to train at Islamabad and other cities for the Asian Games at a time when the country is in grip of heat wave. In order to avoid such problem in future the federal government should build a well-facilitated Sports Complex at Abbottabad where the weather remains moderate in summer and so national camps in that case could be easily held there in future,” Yaqoob told ‘The News’ on Wednesday.
“We have only one mega sports facility in the country in the shape of Pakistan Sports Complex at Islamabad. If at Abbottabad such a facility is managed then the camps could be held there from May to September, a time-frame in which weather in Islamabad is normally hot,” said Yaqoob, also a former top police official.
He said that billions of rupees were wasted on building a sports complex in Narowal which could not be properly utilized as it was very far away.“There was no need to spend such a huge amount on Narowal Sports Complex which is not within the reach of sports fraternity. It would have been much better had land in Abbottabad been purchased and a sports complex built there which could be utilised for national cause,” Yaqoob said.
Around Rs1200 million has been spent on the construction of Narowal Sports Complex which is a multi-sport facility.He said Liaquat Gymnasium, housed in Pakistan Sports Complex Islamabad, is also not air-conditioned which creates a great problem for the volleyballers. “Liaquat Gymnasium is not air-conditioned. When players practice there in hot weather they lose energy and become weak. If you have facility at Abbottabad then you can easily hold camps there in summer,” the official said.
“Mostly international events are held at a time when Pakistan is in grip of hot weather and constructing a complex at Abbottabad will be a long-term solution to the problem,” Yaqoob reiterated.
He said if Islamabad-like sports facilities were managed at Abbottabad then in summer Pakistan would also be able to hold international events there.He also suggested that the state should enhance boarding facility at the Pakistan Sports Complex Islamabad. “If another hotsel is added to the existing ones then it will help meet the future pressure,” Yaqoob said.
About Pakistan’s volleyball team camp for the Asian Games Yaqoob said they had requested the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) for an early camp.“We have requested the Board that our camp should be held early. You know hardly two and a half months time is left which is not sufficient. At least a four-month camp for the Asian Games was needed,” the official pointed out. “Other nations hold camps for such a mega event for years,” he was quick to add.
The Asian Games are pencilled in for August 18 to September 2 in the Indonesian cities of Jakarta and Palembang. He said Pakistan’s youth and junior team camps had also been shifted from Islamabad to Peshawar.
Asian Games camps have not yet been initiated. The PSB will meet federations and Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) on June 6 in Islamabad to finalise some matters regarding the Asiad’s preparations. A few days ago the PSB had to halt the already established camps for the Asian Games due to financial issues.
Yaqoob also informed that Pakistan’s Iranian coach Hamid Movahedi would reach Pakistan on Thursday (today) to join camp in Peshawar. He said that he would handle all the three camps for junior, youth and senior with the assistance of his support staff.",0.9745762944221497,0,1
"...in Abbottabad to promote sports and provide better training facilities for athletes. Speaking at a press conference, Yaqoob emphasized the importance of developing infrastructure to nurture talent in various sports, particularly volleyball, which has seen a surge in popularity across the country.

He highlighted that a dedicated sports complex would not only serve as a training ground for athletes but also host national and international competitions, thereby putting Abbottabad on the sports map of Pakistan. Yaqoob urged the government to allocate funds and resources for this initiative, noting that many young athletes lack access to proper facilities, which hinders their development.

The PVF Chairman also called for collaboration between local authorities and sports organizations to ensure the successful implementation of the project. He expressed optimism that with the right support, Pakistan could produce world-class athletes who could excel in international arenas and bring glory to the nation.",0.7826403975486755,1,1
"Since it's Valentine's Day, Disney thought it would be the perfect time to unveil the first clip from their new live action version of the ""tale as old as time,"" Beauty and the Beast.

"New Delhi: India's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation has not only ""significantly increased the political profile and potential"" of the grouping, but also the groups capacity to help stabilise the situation in Central and South Asia, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday.
Speaking at an event organised by the Vivekananda International Foundation on new vistas of India-Russia relations, the Russian Minister said that India's joining the SCO will also help ""resolve the crisis in and around Afghanistan"".
Earlier, Lavrov said India's ""independent and responsible"" foreign policy has been ""an important factor contributing to global and regional security and stability"" and hoped that this ""legacy would be maintained and strengthened"".
He said that the current volume of trade between the two countries was not ""satisfactory"", and said that the aim is to increase this volume to $30 billion by 2025. He said that as the defence cooperation between the two countries deepens, it will lead to greater transfer of technology and technical know-how from Russia to India.
Lavrov also said the new US strategy of using force in Afghanistan against groups that refuse to cooperate is not likely to work.
""I don't think the recent US strategy on Afghanistan which puts emphasis on use of force to defeat those who refuse to cooperate and engage in violence, frankly, I don't think it would work,"" Lavrov said in response to a media query. ""Like in the last 16 years, the presence of huge army of NATO did not manage either to curb extremism and terrorism or to stop drug trade which has peaked this year. The production of heroin in Afghanistan may have been quadrupled since 9/11,"" he said.
""It is to be understood and accepted that that this is something which feeds terrorist activities directly. And without precursors this drug production would not be possible. Most precursors come from Europe...We should not have double standards towards terrorism,"" the Minister added.
Lavrov also denied any support given by Russia to the Taliban as was being alleged by the US, and added that Russia's contact with Taliban was only to ""pressurise them to sit down and talk"".
""Never ever has there been any proof, any fact that Russia supported the Taliban as suggested by the US. We contacted Taliban only for two reasons. One, when our or our allies' citizens came harm's way and we needed to extract them. And secondly, to pressurise the Taliban to sit down and negotiate. But we always say that they must join negotiations provided they respect the criteria established by the UN Security Council,"" Lavrov said.
Adding that he lately heard US officials calling upon Taliban to join negotiations without any criteria being respected, Lavrov told the audience that they could ""draw your own conclusions"".
Lavrov regretted that the US declined the ""Moscow Process"" and instead decided to go ahead with the ""Six Plus One"" group. The Six Plus One group formed in early 2016 includes India, Pakistan, Iran, Russia, the US and China in addition to Afghanistan.
He said the situation in Afghanistan could not be resolved without having ""everybody"" on board, including ""the government, the Taliban and those who can really influence the situation, including the neighbours"". He said the Kabul Process initiated by the government of Afghanistan in June this year was ""too large"" and that a smaller group of countries would be needed to resolve the political situation including all Central Asian countries.",0.9741100072860718,0,1
"...the region, experts say. With India as a member, the SCO has gained a more balanced representation, enhancing its role in addressing security challenges, particularly in combating terrorism and promoting economic cooperation among member states. Analysts believe that India's participation can lead to more robust dialogues on regional stability, especially concerning Afghanistan and the evolving geopolitical landscape in Central Asia.

Moreover, India's involvement is expected to foster greater connectivity initiatives, linking South Asia with Central Asia through various infrastructure projects. This could potentially open new avenues for trade and investment, benefiting not just member countries but also enhancing India's strategic interests in the region.

As the SCO prepares for its upcoming summit, the focus will likely be on collaborative efforts to tackle pressing issues such as climate change, energy security, and public health, with India playing a pivotal role in shaping the agenda and fostering multilateral cooperation among the diverse member states.",0.7828382849693298,1,1

"There’s a new salon at Bergdorf Goodman that is focused not on your hair, but on your scalp.
“Women get facials, they get their manicure, they get their hair done and their whole body scrubbed,” says Jay Ree, a stylist at the John Barrett “head spa,” which opened at the Fifth Avenue department store this fall. “The only thing that’s missing is their scalp.”
A post shared by Gisoo Salon (@gisoosalon) on Oct 26, 2017 at 12:19pm PDT
Scalp care is the new skin care. Beauty companies such as R+Co, IGK and Briogeo have recently launched scalp scrubs, shampoos or treatments. And an increasing number of NYC spas such as Pierre Michel Salon and Elizabeth Arden’s Red Door are increasingly adding scalp “facials” to their menus — which promise that scrubs and lengthy scalp massages for around $50 to $75 will reduce dirt, debris and gunk that clog your follicles. John Barrett’s treatment, which includes a scalp steam and a blowout, goes for $250.
'THIGHLIGHTING' IS THE PAINFUL NEW PLASTIC SURGERY FAD
“I think before, people only thought they had a scalp problem if they had dandruff or psoriasis and were going to a dermatologist,” says the NYC-based Nancy Twine, founder of Briogeo, whose natural, scalp-revival shampoo is currently the top-selling shampoo on Sephora. “But now more people are realizing that scalp care is important.”
The hair follicle looks and acts very much like the pores on your face. Just as bacteria and dirt in the pores can cause acne and irritation, so, too, can it affect the hair follicle. “There’s just build-up from using products, especially if they’re silicon-based, and over time they start to build up bad bacteria that can cause inflammation and itchiness and even hair loss,” says Twine.
Ree says that New Yorkers have it particularly bad.

“Pollution definitely plays a big part in scalp hygiene,” he says. Ree explains that at the head spa, the stylists take a picture of clients’ scalps using a magnifying lens — and the results are horrifying. “They’ll see a big buildup of mucus, usually on the bottom of the hair follicle, or the scalp is very oily, it’s cracked, it’s dry. It’s gross.”
Another potential culprit, says Twine: dry shampoo, which is applied directly to the scalp to help users go longer between washes, but can clog follicles in the process.

Twine says that taking care of your scalp isn’t rocket science. She recommends washing one’s hair at least once a week and using a scalpcentric shampoo — one with essential oils, such as tea tree or peppermint, with anti-fungal properties and detoxifying ingredients such as clay or activated charcoal — once every one to two weeks. And the most important thing to do is use your fingers to rigorously massage your scalp every time you shampoo. “It really does help loosen the dirt and oil,” she says.
Ree says he thinks the new scalp shampoos and products will revolutionize the way we think about our hair and skin. “I’ve been doing this for 20 years, and I’ve never seen anything that can combat scalp buildup before,” he says. “It’s quite fascinating.”

"England’s Chief Inspector of Hospitals has told East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust that it must make improvements after it was rated as Requires Improvement by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust provides emergency medical services to Bedfordshire and was rated as Requires Improvement overall following an inspection which took place in March this year, the trust was rated as Outstanding for whether its services were caring and Requires Improvement for whether its services were safe, effective, well-led and responsive.
CQC’s Chief Inspector of Hospitals, Professor Ted Baker, said: “Our inspectors found some progress had been made at the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust, since our previous inspection, but that a number of improvements were still clearly needed. We found improvements had been made with regard to safeguarding, staff understanding of the Mental Capacity Act and incident reporting procedures. But the trust still did not meet national ambulance response standards and over the winter period delays resulted in a number of serious incidents.
“We were also concerned that, at the time of our inspection, staff morale was low. People working at the trust described a culture of late shift finishes, frustration at not being able to provide the service they wanted to due to pressures on the trust and disengagement between front line staff and the senior management team. People said they did not always feel valued, particularly after what had been an exhausting winter.
“However, we found a number of areas of outstanding practice and that staff were overwhelmingly caring and dedicated to providing the best care they could to patients. People who used the service also gave positive feedback.
“We fed our findings back to the trust immediately after our inspection, citing the areas where improvements must be made as a priority, and we have been monitoring the trust, working closely with NHS Improvement and other stakeholders, to help drive through improvements. The trust leadership knows what action it must take to bring about improvement and we will return to inspect and check on its progress.”
East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust acknowledged that there is always room for improvement but it was pleased to see that the CQC recognised improvement across some of the individual areas of rating.
The Trust’s Chief Executive Robert Morton said: “Yet again our staff were rated as ‘outstanding’ for caring.
“The improvements the CQC saw were in some areas of the Patient Transport Services and our Emergency Operations Centres where we handle and triage 999 calls.
“I’d like to thank everyone who welcomed the inspection team and gave their views, supported our colleagues in providing a wealth of data and information to the CQC before, during and after the inspection, and represented the ‘We Are EEAST’ approach to our caring and compassionate work.
“The CQC inspected the Trust at a time when staff were extremely tired and under pressure.. There will always be room for improvement.”
There are several areas where improvements must be made, including that the trust must improve its performance and response times for emergency calls and ensure processes and procedures are consistently applied across the trust.
Risk registers must be reviewed and staff must be appropriately mentored and supported to carry out their roles.
Robert added: “We are aware of the many challenges we face here in the east. Engaging with our staff, across a virtual organisation which is spread out across a an area of 7,500 square miles, can be a huge task.
“Our workforce are highly mobile and travel approx 12 million miles a year supporting or delivering the best care we can to patients.
“We are working to ensure the leaders at every level in our organisation are given the time and space to build effective, communicative teams at a local level – particularly during tough periods like winter.
“We are a united Board-level team with a wide range of expertise and experience to help us strengthen our service and help EEAST remain focused on our patients.
“The care we provide for them means we’re in the best position ever to provide the modern, high-quality and sustainable health services our communities need.
“With the right investment, including £11.5m of additional funding this year - we will get better and better.”",0.9682683348655701,0,1
"...Commission (CQC) following an inspection. The CQC highlighted several areas of concern, including response times and the need for better management of resources. The report indicated that while some staff demonstrated a commitment to providing high-quality care, there were inconsistencies in service delivery that affected patient outcomes.

The Chief Inspector emphasized the importance of addressing these issues promptly to ensure that patients receive timely and effective care. In particular, the report pointed out that the ambulance service struggled to meet national response time targets, which could jeopardize patient safety in critical situations.

In response, the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust acknowledged the findings and expressed its commitment to making the necessary improvements. The Trust has outlined a plan to enhance training for staff, improve communication systems, and invest in additional resources to better meet the needs of the community. Stakeholders are hopeful that these changes will lead to a significant turnaround in service quality.",0.6847826242446899,1,1
"Home is usually where the heart is, unless you are the New York Rangers.
Sunday night’s 3-1 Game 3 loss to the Montreal Canadiens was the Blueshirts’ sixth-consecutive home playoff loss at Madison Square Garden dating back to the 2014-15 postseason.
Their last victory came in Game 1 of the 2015 Eastern Conference Finals against the Tampa Bay Lightning, which was a series they lost in seven games.
Over those six losses — which included three to Tampa Bay, two to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round last year and Sunday night against Montreal — the Rangers offense has been nonexistent having been outscored 21-4.
Goaltender Henrik Lundqvist, who has carried the Rangers at times throughout his postseason career, has not been his usual stellar self during that stretch either with a .873 save percentage.
“We have to give more at home in the playoffs or we aren’t going to win,” Lundqvist said after Game 3. “We need more. It’s as simple as that.”
No one was exempt from his criticism either.
“Every little detail matters,” Lundqvist said. “Every play … We’re going to need our best.”
It has left head coach Alain Vigneault and his team facing a 2-1 series deficit ahead of Tuesday night’s Game 4 at Madison Square Garden and frustration has slowly crept into the New York locker room.
“There’s no doubt in my mind that this group of players wants to do well in front of their fans,” Vigneault said. “Right now, we’re fighting it without a doubt. That should be evident.”
Right-winger Rick Nash certainly felt it.
“Yeah [I feel frustrated],” he said. “I mean, any time you’re not having success and you’re getting chances and opportunities, there’s definitely some frustration.”
Center Derek Stepan acknowledged that struggle as well.
“We can’t let it happen,” he said. “Just can’t have any panic in your game.”
It was clear that there was something off about the Rangers’ play during Game 3. Despite having the home crowd behind them, New York looked hesitant to attack the Montreal goal and passed up a number of shot opportunities.
The lack of aggression saw the Rangers record just six shots apiece in the first and second periods. They tallied just 21 shots all game, making Canadiens goalie Carey Price’s job far easier than Lundqvist’s.
Through the opening three games of the series, Lundqvist has already faced 29 more shots than Price, which is an entire game’s worth.
There have been plenty of chances for the Rangers to bombard the Montreal net too, especially on the man advantage. However, that tentative play has left the Rangers snakebitten and 0-for-10 on the power play so far this series.
“We don’t get a lot of shots. A lot of one and dones,” defenseman and captain Ryan McDonagh said. “We’re not making passes in the offensive zone, just making hope plays.”
Vigneault honed in on his best players and laid some of the blame on them.
“At this time, right now, our fourth line is our best line,” Vigneault said. “So our top players need to find their game and they obviously don’t have it right now.”
The Rangers did indeed feed off the energy exhibited by the fourth line. Center Oscar Lindberg had New York’s best chance in the first period on Sunday when his wrister hit the post while Tanner Glass and Jesper Fast provided a high-intensity style of play during their limited time on the ice.
New York’s first line of Chris Kreider, Stepan and Mats Zuccarello have accounted for just one goal through the first three games of the series. Third-line winger Michael Grabner already has two.
At the end of the day though, it’s only a one-game deficit for now. A strong showing on Tuesday night can rectify any reservations surrounding the team and allow them to seize momentum for their trip back to Montreal for Game 5.
“This is the playoffs,” Nash said. “You have to figure out what you’re doing wrong and get over it.”",0.9490445852279663,0,1
"...defeat, a troubling trend that has left fans and players alike searching for answers. The Rangers, who had high hopes for a deep playoff run, struggled to find their rhythm at Madison Square Garden, where they had previously thrived during the regular season. 

Despite a strong start to the game, with an early goal from their captain, the team faltered as the Canadiens capitalized on defensive lapses. The crowd, once a source of energy, grew increasingly restless as the game wore on, echoing the frustration felt by the players on the ice. 

Coach Gerard Gallant emphasized the need for a mental reset, urging his team to focus on the next game and not dwell on past failures. ""We have to find a way to turn this around,"" he said. With the series now shifting back to Montreal, the Rangers face a critical moment in their playoff journey, needing to reclaim their confidence and home-ice advantage.",0.7371024489402771,1,1
"Ahmed Saad / Reuters People look at a burned vehicle at the site of car bomb attack in a busy square at Baghdad's sprawling Sadr City district, in Iraq January 2, 2017.
BAGHDAD/TIKRIT, Iraq, Jan 2 (Reuters) - An Islamic State car bomb killed 24 people in a busy square in Baghdad’s sprawling Sadr City district on Monday, and the militants cut a key road north from the capital to Mosul, their last major stronghold in the country.
An online statement distributed by Amaq news agency, which supports Islamic State, said the ultra-hardline Sunni group had targeted a gathering of Shi’ite Muslims, whom it considers apostates. Sixty-seven people were wounded in the blast.
U.S.-backed Iraqi forces are currently fighting to push Islamic State from the northern city of Mosul, but are facing fierce resistance. The group has lost most of the territory it seized in a blitz across northern and western Iraq in 2014.
The recapture of Mosul would probably spell the end for its self-styled caliphate, but the militants would still be capable of fighting a guerrilla-style insurgency in Iraq, and plotting or inspiring attacks on the West.
Three bombs killed 29 people across the capital on Saturday, and an attack near the southern city of Najaf on Sunday left seven policemen dead. Monday’s blast in Sadr City hit a square where day laborers typically gather.
Nine of the victims were women in a passing minibus. Their charred bodies were visible inside the burnt-out remains of the vehicle. Blood stained the ground nearby.
A separate blast near a hospital in central Baghdad killed one civilian and wounded nine, police and medical sources said.
“The terrorists will attempt to attack civilians in order to make up for their losses, but we assure the Iraqi people and the world that we are able to end terrorism and shorten its life,” Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told reporters after meeting with visiting French President Francois Hollande.
Hollande, whose country has faced a series of militant attacks in the past two years, said French soldiers serving in a U.S.-led coalition against the jihadists in Iraq were preventing more mass killings at home.
Ahmed Saad / Reuters People gather at the site of car bomb attack in a busy square at Baghdad's sprawling Sadr City district, in Iraq January 2, 2017.
ROAD TO MOSUL
Since the drive to recapture Mosul began on Oct. 17, elite forces have retaken a quarter of the city in the biggest ground operation in Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Abadi has said the group will be driven out of the country by April.
Clashes continued in and around Mosul on Monday. The counter-terrorism service (CTS) blew up several Islamic State car bombs before they reached their targets, and linked up with the Rapid Response forces, an elite Interior Ministry unit, said spokesman Sabah al-Numani.
CTS was also clearing North Karma district of remaining militants, the fourth area the unit has retaken in the past week, he said.
Islamic State targeted military positions away from the main battlefield, killing at least 16 pro-government fighters and cutting a strategic road linking the city to Baghdad.
Militants attacked an army barracks near Baiji, 180 km (110 miles) north of the capital, killing four soldiers and wounding 12 people, including Sunni tribal fighters, army and police sources said.
They seized weapons there and launched mortars at nearby Shirqat, forcing security forces to impose a curfew and close schools and offices in the town, according to local officials and security sources.
Shirqat mayor Ali Dodah said Islamic State seized three checkpoints on the main road linking Baiji to Shirqat following the attacks. Shelling in Shirqat had killed at least two children, he told Reuters by phone.
In a separate incident, gunmen broke into a village near Udhaim, 90 km (56 miles) north of Baghdad, where they executed nine Sunni tribal fighters with shots to the head, police and medical sources said.",0.9549950361251831,0,1
"...15, 2023. The explosion, which occurred during peak hours, left at least 20 people dead and dozens more injured, according to local authorities. Eyewitnesses described a scene of chaos as emergency responders rushed to the site, where debris and shattered glass littered the ground. 

Security forces cordoned off the area, while ambulances transported the wounded to nearby hospitals. Many victims were civilians, including women and children, who were caught in the blast while going about their daily routines. 

The attack has been attributed to ongoing sectarian violence in the region, with officials expressing concerns over the resurgence of extremist groups. In a statement, the Iraqi Prime Minister condemned the attack and vowed to enhance security measures in the capital. 

As the investigation continues, residents of Sadr City are left grappling with the aftermath, mourning their losses and fearing for their safety in a city still reeling from years of conflict.",0.6465287208557129,1,1
"Jerome ""Jay"" Powell, the Republican former investment banker tapped by President Donald Trump to lead the US Federal Reserve, will take the reins of monetary policy starting Monday.Perhaps the wealthiest Fed chair ever, Powell -- who turns 65 on Sunday -- succeeds Janet Yellen, who ends the first and only term held by a woman.He takes over at a remarkably quiet time following a decade of economic turmoil that forced the central bank into uncharted policy waters to try to recover from the global financial crisis.Nevertheless, Powell, one of the rare non-economists to fill the role, could soon face difficult policy decisions that will put him at the center of debate over how fast to raise interest rates.Wages in January posted the biggest annual increase in nearly 10 years, with the growing US economy adding jobs at a solid pace, and while business and consumer confidence remains high just as a massive corporate tax reform is starting to take effect.This comes at a time when all major global economies are growing simultaneously, an unusual and happy coincidence, but one that begins to raise concerns about when the recovery will end. And how.""His biggest challenge will be leading the further calibration of interest rates when the US economy is late cycle amid a synchronized global economic upswing and fiscal stimulus is on its way,"" Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics told AFP.As Yellen departs, the only Fed chair in nearly 40 years not to be reappointed for a second term, she leaves an economy with unemployment at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent -- half the rate when she became chair -- quiet inflation and nearly four years of uninterrupted growth.In addition, she steered the Fed out of its massive bond buying program and began the process of ""normalization,"" or reducing the size of investment holdings, without upsetting the skittish financial markets.Yellen prevailed in the debate to raise interest rates only gradually to ensure the economic recovery was on solid footing. The Fed has raised the key lending rate five times in her tenure, including three times last year.""Yellen hands the incoming Chair Jerome Powell a more 'normalized' economic and monetary policy environment,"" Bostjancic said.The Fed in December raised the benchmark lending rate for the third time last year, and indicated that another three hikes were likely this year.But the minutes of the meeting show there was heated debate among the policymakers about how quickly they would need to move this year based on differing outlooks for inflation and the impact of the tax cuts.Inflation has remained stubbornly below the Fed's two percent target, but the policy statement last week said the central bank expects prices to move up in the near term.The first rate increase of 2018 is widely expected to come in March, which also will feature the first press conference by Powell, who has served on the Fed board since 2012.""Massive fiscal policy piled on top of an economy that was growing solidly and has limited labor availability has not been tried before,"" economist Joel Naroff said.""How this 'Grand Fiscal Experiment' affects wage and price inflation is something Fed has to be worried about.""In practical terms, raising rates more quickly has challenges.The Fed can decide to move at any time, whether it has a policy meeting scheduled or not, but officials like to telegraph their intentions to markets clearly to avoid any upset, and explain the decision once it has been made.So since 2011, the committee has only announced rate changes at one of the quarterly meetings that include press conferences by the Fed chair. That means a faster pace of rate hikes would mean four rather than three this year. More increases than that could really spook markets into thinking the Fed is seeing real cause for concern about the threat of inflation or the durability of the recovery.",1.0113177299499512,0,1
"...individual to hold the position in recent history, Powell's appointment comes at a time of significant economic uncertainty. With interest rates at historic lows and inflation beginning to rise, he faces the challenge of balancing growth with the need to prevent overheating in the economy. 

Powell, who has served on the Federal Reserve Board since 2012, is known for his pragmatic approach to monetary policy. He has emphasized the importance of data-driven decisions and has expressed a commitment to transparency in the Fed's operations. 

As he steps into the role, Powell will need to navigate complex issues such as trade tensions, labor market dynamics, and the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. His leadership will be closely scrutinized by both lawmakers and economists, as they look for signals on how the Fed will respond to evolving economic conditions in the coming months.",0.6650412678718567,1,1
"Google's Project Fi, a phone service that in the U.S. piggybacks off the major carriers and Wi-Fi, has added three new phones that will work with the service, additions that could interest more customers.
But without Apple's iPhone as an option, the foray is still likely to remain somewhat of a curiosity.
On Wednesday, Google announced that three new handsets will be coming soon to Fi, starting with the budget-oriented $199 moto G6 that is now available for preorder. Motorola’s phone normally goes for $50 or more.
The other devices, both from LG, are higher-end smartphones: the $740 LG G7 ThinQ and the $899 LG V35 ThinQ.
Project Fi quietly has been plugging along since April 2015 when Google launched its then-invitation-only phone service. Very few phones are compatible with the service, which has remained low-key.
These latest phones, each with large screens, portrait mode-equipped cameras and expandable storage, join the only others in what remains a thin Project Fi portfolio: Google’s own Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL; the Android One moto x4; plus the older Google devices that are still supported, the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Pixel and Pixel XL.
Expanding the Fi lineup certainly is a positive, but it’s still difficult to imagine that Fi will suddenly gain a bevy of new customers, especially since it still lacks the most prized phones on the market from Apple and Samsung.
“The handset choice — or better, the lack of it — is a big hurdle,” says Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics. “Not having iPhones is literally halving its addressable market.”
Fi never emerged as the disruptive force in wireless that some predicted when rumors first surfaced that Google had designs on becoming an Internet Service Provider. For its part, Google maintained that it wasn’t trying to overtake the cellular business but rather to showcase what was possible when the company could manage the hardware in its devices, the software in Android and the connectivity with Fi.
The appeal of the service for consumers is that Google charges low rates — $20 a month for unlimited calls and texts, plus $10 for each gigabyte of data up to 6GB. But Google doesn’t charge you for data you don’t use.
Of course, the environment has changed since 2015, with consumers now having many attractive unlimited wireless plans from which to choose.
Google’s network is actually an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) that in the U.S. uses T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular and automatically chooses the fastest and strongest available network to glom onto, whether that’s cellular or Wi-Fi.(Overseas, it works with a European provider Three.)
Google didn’t answer a question on how a T-Mobile/Sprint merger, if approved, might impact Fi.
Nor has Google said how many customers use Fi, though the company claims a ""healthy user base"" and ""high customer satisfaction.""
“I don't think it is growing much if any at all,” Entner says. “Advertising and promotion is the lifeblood of any wireless brand. Without it, and I haven't seen any advertising for it, it languishes. As the name indicates it's a project, not a product.”

"...expand its offerings and provide users with more options. The newly supported devices include the latest models from popular manufacturers, ensuring that customers can choose from a range of styles and features that suit their needs. 

With these additions, Project Fi now supports a total of over a dozen devices, allowing users to take advantage of its unique pricing structure, which charges only for the data they use. This flexibility is particularly appealing to those who may not require unlimited data plans. 

In addition to the new phones, Google has also announced improvements to its network management, enhancing connectivity and call quality. Users can expect faster data speeds and more reliable service as Project Fi continues to optimize its infrastructure. 

As competition in the mobile service market intensifies, these updates position Project Fi as a compelling choice for consumers looking for a cost-effective and versatile phone service solution.",0.7810980081558228,1,1

Manchester United would be willing to sell David de Gea to Real Madrid but only if they get Gareth Bale in return, according ot reports.
Real's interest in De Gea is a popular line during summer transfer windows and the Old Trafford club fully expect Los Blancos to come knocking again at the end of the season.
The move went close three years ago and with his contract up in 2019 it could be their best chance in a while to get him.
Spanish website Don Balon claim the only way De Gea is going to the Bernabeu is if Bale comes the other way.
However, back in January, De Gea insisted he was happy at United in a bid to deflect links with a return to the Spanish capital.

Manchester United legend Alex Ferguson inspiring Jose Mourinho
Jose Mourinho is already plotting how to catch Manchester City next season — after taking his lead from Man United predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson.
Ferguson admitted Mourinho's Chelsea forced his Red Devils to up their game when the Special One led the Londoners to consecutive Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006.
Now, Mourinho finds himself in a similar position with Pep Guardiola's City, conceding United will have to step up a significant level next season if they are to bridge a gap that stands at 15 points with 13 games to go.
(Image: AMA/WBA FC via Getty)
“I always remember Sir Alex said in 2005-06, when we won the second title with Chelsea, that we [United] need to improve a lot because they've raised the bar to such a level,” said Mourinho, whose United side host struggling Huddersfield on Saturday.
“They [Chelsea] won two titles in a row - the second title was easier than the first - and then the biggest manager in the Premier League said United needed to improve a lot.

Jose Mourinho concedes Man United are fighting to be 'first of the last'
Jose Mourinho has conceded the title to Manchester City - with 13 games left of the Premier League campaign.
Manchester United's 2-0 defeat away to Tottenham left them 15 points behind Pep Guardiola's runaway leaders, with Mourinho conceding his side are now in a battle to be ""the first of the last"".
United host Huddersfield tomorrow and Mourinho admitted his side now to focus their attention on ensuring they secure a top-four spot, with fifth-placed Spurs just five points behind them.
""The game is important because we need points to be the first of the last,"" said Mourinho.

""We have to try to finish second. We are in this position all season — we were first for a few weeks and then we were always second.
""I don't remember us being fourth, fifth or sixth. We have been there since the beginning of the season, better than last season in every aspect - points, position, number of goals scored, number of goals conceded, better in everything.
""So we have to try to stay there and it's not easy, because there are very good teams around us. Chelsea are champions again, and a had a fantastic market, Liverpool are a great team, Arsenal improved a lot in the market.
""Tottenham are a fantastic team and are five points behind us, so we're doing quite well, with some negative moments - Wednesday was one. It's very important to do better than last season and try to win something and, if not, do better.""",0.9574660658836365,0,1
"Gea this summer if the right offer comes in, as the club looks to reshape its squad under new management. The Spanish goalkeeper, who has been a key figure for United since joining in 2011, has seen his form fluctuate in recent seasons, leading to questions about his long-term future at Old Trafford.

Sources indicate that United is open to exploring options for De Gea, particularly if they can secure a suitable replacement. The club has been linked with several potential targets, including top performers from across Europe. De Gea's hefty wage demands and the emergence of younger goalkeeping talents have also contributed to the club's willingness to consider a sale.

As the transfer window approaches, fans will be watching closely to see how this situation unfolds. The decision to part ways with a player of De Gea's caliber would mark a significant shift for Manchester United as they aim to return to the top of English football.",0.7884012460708618,1,1

"The Rocks celebrated the arrival of 2017 on top of the league after a 92nd minute own-goal gave them a 1-0 win at Metropolitan Police.
The three points put them level on points with Needham Market - whose game had been postponed the previous day - but on top thanks to a better goal difference.
It set them up nicely for Monday’s visit to big rivals Worthing (1pm).
They welcomed Brighton loanee Dylan Barnett back into the starting line-up and had youngster Oscar Haynes-Brown, a student from from Ardingly College who has represented England schools, on the bench.
In the second minute, James Crane’s pass picked out Ollie Pearce down the left. His cross found Jimmy Wild but his header flashed wide.
Calvin Davies stole the ball in midfield to pass to Wild. He composed himself before shooting low but it was well stopped by Seb Brown, a loanee from Chelsea, for the hosts.
James Harper bounced the home side’s first chance into the turf and Dan Lincoln saved after Met Police capitalised on a poor throw by Harvey Whyte.
Roman Michael-Percil steamed down the left to set up Sam Williams. From outside the box, Williams slammed his shot well over the crossbar.
Lloyd Macklin teed up Orlando Smith, who smacked it low amd wide of the right post.
Wild won a corner on 10 minutes and Pearce’s kick found Ed Sanders, whose header appeared to touch a hand in the area but the penalty claims were ignored.
Pearce’s cross flashed across the box but Wild wasn’t quite there to finish it.
Olli Robinson’s long throw had to be gathered by Lincoln – before Barnett hit a shot from long range, forcing Brown into a save.
Pearce’s corner on 20 minutes picked out an unmarked Sami El-Abd whose header was pushed over the bar by the goalkeeper. Soon after a Davies shot was deflected wide.
Pearce’s corner was punched out to Crane, whose shot was well blocked on 25 minutes.
James Fraser was booked as he threw the ball away. Then after Robinson’s trademark throw got headed out, the ball bobbled to Smith, whose shot bounced wide.
Following a Pearce corner another handball appeal went ignored as a shot from long distance appeared to hit a defender’s elbow in the box.
Wild couldn’t direct a header towards goal from a Barnett cross on 35 minutes.
Crane forced a fingertip save from the goalkeeper – then the same Rocks player’s incisive pass picked out Barnett, who curled it at goal, but Brown pushed it around the post on 40 minutes.
During first-half stoppage time, Ola Sogbamnu’s attempt from inside the area was well saved by Lincoln and the follow-up was also blocked.
HT 0-0
Michael-Percil’s cross from the left was pinged to the back post but Crane was there to head it into the air and Lincoln gathered it.
Barnett won a free-kick for Bognor on 47 minutes. Barnett’s cross was curled into the heart of the area, but it flew through the crowded box and off for a goal kick.
A Macklin cross was well gathered by Lincoln before Barnett’s dipping cross was well stopped by the goalkeeper.
Sanders had to head off the line as Michael-Percil stubbed one at goal with Lincoln beaten on 55 minutes. Lincoln gathered the ball after Sanders’ heroics.
Michael-Percil went to ground under a challenge by El-Abd which was waved away by the referee.
Sogbamnu forced a parried save from Lincoln on 60 minutes before Davies was shown a yellow card for a foul.
Wild was replaced by Alex Parsons on 62 minutes.
Michael-Percil got himself into space before shooting low and committing Lincoln into a stop.
Charlie Collins and Dan Summers came on for Smith and Michael-Percil on 66 minutes.
Collins took a corner straight after coming on. He picked out Robinson, who headed just wide.
Davies was replaced by Chad Field on 68 minutes.
Barnett’s corner on the right found Fraser but his glanced header was narrowly off-target.
Field won it the ball in midfield to find Fraser. The midfielder passed to Parsons, who cut inside before seeing his shot deflected away by Brown.
A free-kick by Pearce had to be punched away by the keeper as Bognor continued to try to find a way past the stopper with crosses.
Parsons was brought down in the middle of the pitch by Harper, who was booked for the challenge.
Luke Robertson came on for Sogbamnu on 78 minutes for the hosts.
Doug Tuck was replaced by new player, Oscar Haynes Brown, who took to the field on 80 minutes.
A Barnett free-kick was dipping towards Field but a defender knocked it out for a corner which was cleared.
Whyte’s shot was deflected for a corner and the resulting kick by Barnett was headed away.
A short corner saw Pearce combine with Barnett before whipping it into the area, but Sanders’ header looped over the bar on 85 minutes.
Bognor won the ball again when a one-two move saw Barnett receive the ball from Parsons but his spinning attempt flew just over.
The rocks had been pressing for the winner and their travelling fans were in raptures when it arrived two minutes into injury time.
Parsons found space on the right and play the ball in low into the path of Brown, whose effort hit the post and then bounced off Steve Sutherland and in, sparking celebrations from the players and supporters.
There was no time for Met Police to rescue it and the Rocks could head home knowing they’d be top for the turn of the year.

This comes after de Lesseps and the businessman settled out of court, according to records obtained byThe Blast on Wednesday.
The divorce came through on September 18, making The Countess a single woman once again after her short-lived second marriage.
The couple married on December 31, 2016, but announced their split just eight months later in August after Tom continued his flirtatious ways with other women.
She tweeted at the time: 'It’s with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce. We care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!'

Luann and Tom's relationship was featured on RHONY over the course of several seasons.
They were on and off so frequently that fellow Housewife Bethenny Frankel even pleaded with LuAnn not to tie the knot with Tom before their wedding.
The reality star famously had to give up her Countess title to marry Tom.
The reality star is getting over her broken heart by volunteering for the Red Cross in the Florida Keys, devastated by Hurricane Irma last month.
Speaking to People on Wednesday, Luann said she had just heard the news about her divorce.
'It’s what we both decided upon in the end, and even though we decided that, it’s sad,' she said.

"Our short showers and drizzle aren’t going away. But the dayslong drenchings that sometimes soak the city? They’ve been happening more, according to a Seattle Public Utilities study.
Attention, Seattle residents: Have you noticed more steady, long-lasting rainstorms in a city better known for gray skies, short showers and drizzle? Turns out you’re on to something.
Over the last 15 years, the city’s had more extreme rain, according to a new study by Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) officials, who say the weather is a climate-change preview.
“This confirms our anecdotal evidence,” said James Rufo-Hill, an SPU meteorologist. “For years, people have been saying, ‘I think the rain is getting worse around here,’ and now the data shows that.”
SPU has been measuring rainfall for about four decades with gauges in 17 locations across the city, such as Magnuson Park, the Maple Leaf Reservoir, Fauntleroy Ferry Dock and Aki Kurose Middle School.
The information from the gauges helps SPU plan and design drainage and sewage projects, Rufo-Hill said.
The last major rainfall study was in 2003, so SPU had some catching up to do. The sprinklings most common in Seattle aren’t going away, according to Rufo-Hill. And the city’s rare flash storms aren’t necessarily worsening.
Seattle has a longer-than-average rainy season, but is only 44th nationally in total accumulation, less than such cities as Atlanta, Houston and New York.
That’s partly because our typical rain comes from low, layered clouds rather than high, dense clouds. And that may be a reason why many of us are umbrella-averse.
“Most of the rain we get hasn’t changed,” Rufo-Hill said.
But according to the SPU study released in December, “extreme” rainstorms have become more common — and more extreme.
What exactly does that mean? SPU measures storms by how long they last and how much rain they dump, and then categorizes those storms based on how often they can be expected to occur.
What used to be considered a once-in-a-century storm for a 24-hour period — 4 inches — can now be expected once every 25 years, according to Rufo-Hill. The new standard for a once-in-a-century storm for a 24-hour period is more than 5 inches.
Another example based on the addition of 15 years of data: What used to be a once-in-a-century storm for a 6-hour period — 1.86 inches — can now be expected every 25 years, according to SPU’s modeling.
Also becoming more extreme are rainstorms lasting six hours and those lasting three days with levels of precipitation expected every five or 10 years. Another, more poetic name for these superstorms: “atmospheric rivers.”
“Our definitions of extreme and normal have changed,” Rufo-Hill said.
Here’s something confusing: Seattle has been hit with at least 4 inches of rain in 24 hours several times since SPU started keeping track — in 1981, 1986, 2003, 2007 and 2010. That’s a lot more than once every 25 years.
What gives? SPU’s projections take the superlong view rather than concentrating only on what’s happened since its gauges were installed in 1977, Rufo-Hill said.
“We’re doing the best we can with the sample size we have,” he said.
Wanting it to stop
The science is complicated, but some long-timers say it sure seems like the change has been easy to see.
“I used to be able to pedal my bike and stay dry with the evaporation,” said John Dunlap, who moved to Seattle about 40 years ago.
“It’s not like that now,” said Dunlap, who was shopping at REI for cross-country skiing gear and hoping for some extreme snow in the mountains. “The drops are bigger.”
Terrie Botts, a retired engineer, isn’t the type of person to trust her instincts. She likes evidence. But the lifelong area resident also has wondered whether the skies are dumping more rain on her town. Not that she minds.
“I’m in harmony with the rain,” Botts said. “I’m not somebody who gets bummed out.”
Then there’s Jose Mayorquin, a web developer. He thinks the SPU data make sense, having noticed more storms that “last all day long and I just want it to stop.”
But Mayorquin, who grew up in Seattle, sees a silver lining amid the city’s recent population explosion.
“Hopefully it’ll stop people from moving here,” he quipped.
Not likely, with a record number of apartment buildings under construction. Down the block in booming South Lake Union, Jesse Peck was working on one of them, grateful for a break in the rain.
Downpours make construction work harder and wetter, said the electrician, who lives in Sultan.
“We have guys working eight hours a day just dealing with the water that gets in” before a building is fitted with windows and roof, he said. “Seems like there are more days where it never stops raining.”
David Laskin wrote the book on that. Literally. The self-described “weather nut” penned “Rains All the Time: A Connoisseur’s History of Weather in the Pacific Northwest.”
“The one thing I love most about rain in Seattle is the variability. My personal favorite is the convergence-zone rain, where you can see the air masses come together with pouring rain,” he said. “I think most weather nuts tend to love extremes.”
The new measurements matter — and not only because they interest amateur weather watchers like Laskin, Rufo-Hill said.
Built for a drip
SPU will use the information to help make decisions about projects that prevent flooding and protect the environment.
In parts of the city with pipes that receive both sewage from buildings and stormwater from streets, rainstorms can overwhelm the system and send a nasty mixture spewing into local waterways.
To comply with a 2013 consent decree, SPU is building an enormous storage tunnel under the Lake Washington Ship Canal. The tunnel will keep nearly 60 million gallons of polluted water out of the canal each year.
That effort is already on its way, but future projects will benefit from the new rainfall data, Rufo-Hill said.
“When we’re putting a pipe in the ground, we’ll use this data in combination with other information to determine exactly how much larger it should be,” the SPU scientist said.
“Generally speaking, Seattle’s drainage and wastewater infrastructure was sized for a different climate,” he added. “Seattle’s system was built for a drip, not a downpour, and we’re seeing more downpours.”
The rainfall information also is important because scientists like Rufo-Hill think climate change will ensure that extreme rainstorms continue.
“We may have just gone through a period of variability. But the best-available science suggests” there will be change over the long term, he said.
Mayor Jenny Durkan mentioned the increase in extreme rainstorms this week while touting steps she contends the city must take to combat climate change, such as installing electric-vehicle charging stations and solar panels.
“Cities don’t have the luxury of climate denial and cannot wait for federal leaders to embrace science. The effect of inaction is already at our doorstep,” Durkan said in a statement.
SPU’s study, Rufo-Hill said, jibes with local rainfall data collected by the National Weather Service.
And Logan Johnson, meteorologist-in-charge at the service’s Seattle weather-forecast office, brought up another reason to pay attention.
“This study underscores the need to better prepare for flooding, not only in Seattle, but throughout Western Washington,” Johnson said.",0.9412258863449097,0,1
"...residents: prepare for a wetter future. The study highlights a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events over the past few decades. Researchers found that while light rain remains common, the number of days with heavy downpours has risen by nearly 30%. This trend is attributed to climate change, which is altering weather patterns and leading to more extreme precipitation.

City officials are urging residents to take proactive measures to mitigate flooding risks. ""We need to adapt our infrastructure to handle these changes,"" said a spokesperson for Seattle Public Utilities. Plans are underway to enhance stormwater management systems and improve drainage in vulnerable areas. 

As the city braces for more intense storms, community engagement is crucial. Residents are encouraged to participate in local workshops to learn about flood preparedness and sustainable practices. With the changing climate, Seattle must come together to safeguard its neighborhoods against the increasing threat of heavy rainfall.",0.6577831506729126,1,1
"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will take action to defend its interests if the United States damages trade ties, the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump authorized an inquiry into China's alleged theft of intellectual property.
Trump's move, the first direct trade measure by his administration against China, comes at a time of heightened tension over North Korea's nuclear ambitions, though it is unlikely to prompt near-term change in commercial ties.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will have a year to look into whether to launch a formal investigation of China's policies on intellectual property, which the White House and U.S. industry groups say are harming U.S. businesses and jobs.
The United States should respect objective facts, act prudently, abide by its World Trade Organization pledges, and not destroy principles of multilateralism, an unidentified spokesman of China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.
""If the U.S. side ignores the facts, and disrespects multilateral trade principles in taking actions that harms both sides trade interests, China will absolutely not sit by and watch, will inevitably adopt all appropriate measures, and resolutely safeguard China's lawful rights.""
The ministry said the United States should ""treasure"" the cooperation and favorable state of China-U.S. trade relations, and warned that any U.S. action to damage ties would ""harm both sides trade relations and companies"".
China was continuously strengthening its administrative and judicial protections for intellectual property, the ministry added.
China's policy of forcing foreign companies to turn over technology to Chinese joint venture partners and failure to crack down on intellectual property theft have been longstanding problems for several U.S. administrations.
Trump administration officials have estimated that theft of intellectual property by China could be worth as much as $600 billion.
Experts on China trade policy said the long lead time could allow Beijing to discuss some of the issues raised by Washington without being seen to cave to pressure under the threat of reprisals.
China repeatedly rebuffed attempts by previous U.S. administrations to take action on its IP practices, and has insisted it rigorously protects intellectual property.
State news agency Xinhua said the U.S. investigation is a unilateralist ""baring of fangs"" that will hurt both sides.
Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council said Trump's memo is only the beginning of the process, but that he expected a decision on how to move forward from the administration in 60-90 days.
""I think it will be much faster than a year,"" Parker said.
Coming to terms on a bilateral investment treaty would be a better way to get China to address the IP issues, he added.
""This isn't a surprise. Our companies have been honing their crisis communications and internal planning processes since the election. The rhetoric that came up during the campaign led them to take proactive action then. They are prepared, aware and ready for these types of actions going forward.""
The investigation is likely to cast a shadow over U.S. relations with China, its largest trading partner, just as Trump is asking it to put more pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear programm.
Trump has suggested he would be more amenable to going easy on China over trade if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea.
China has said the issues of trade with the United States should not be linked to the North Korea problem.
Ken Jarrett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said in a statement on Tuesday that trade and North Korea should not be linked, but that the investigation was a ""measured and necessary step"".
""The president's executive order reflects building frustration with Chinese trade and market entry policies, particularly those that pressure American companies to part with technologies and intellectual property in exchange for market access,"" he said.
""Chinese companies operating in the United States do not face this pressure.""",1.0229990482330322,0,1
"...announced plans to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods. The ministry emphasized that it would not sit idly by if U.S. actions threatened China's economic interests. ""We will take necessary measures to safeguard our rights and interests,"" a spokesperson stated, highlighting the importance of a stable trade relationship between the two nations.

The announcement comes amid ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China, with both countries engaged in a protracted trade war that has seen tariffs imposed on billions of dollars' worth of goods. Analysts warn that escalating trade disputes could further disrupt global supply chains and economic recovery efforts in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

China's response is expected to include retaliatory tariffs and other trade barriers, as officials seek to protect domestic industries from the impact of U.S. policies. The situation remains fluid, with both sides urged to engage in dialogue to resolve their differences and avoid further escalation.",0.7257683277130127,1,1
"PIMS staff protest continues on 5th day
Islamabad :The Vice Chancellor of the Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University (SZABMU) Prof. Dr. Javed Akram was unceremoniously forced out of his office Friday by teeming protestors demanding separation of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) from the medical university.
Meanwhile, sensing the fury of the protestors, the ministries of Capital Administration and Development Division (CADD) and Law sprung into action with assurances that the summary of the PIMS amendment bill would soon to send to the Prime Minister for approval, given that all legal procedures and formalities pertaining to the bill have been addressed.
Continuing their protest for the fifth consecutive day under the umbrella of the All Employees’ Movement for Restoration of PIMS, the protestors sealed the office of the VC, and resolved not to permit him to occupy his seat under any circumstances. “He will have to vacate the PIMS building,” they shouted amidst deafening slogans. Senior consultants’ participation in the protest has added to the resilience of the emotionally charged employees fighting for separation of the two institutions.
“If they have a problem with my person, I am ready to step down and tender my resignation,” the VC offered. In the same breath, he drew attention to the suffering being endured by the up to 20,000 patients who visit PIMS every day for medical treatment. “I am against cessation of patient services, because patient care comes foremost. We should not endanger the lives of patients by suspending health and medical services,” Prof. Javed said while talking to journalists. He also visited the Parliament House, apparently to inquire about the status of the bill and to explore possibilities for its swift passage.
As promised a day earlier, the Minister for CADD Dr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and core representatives of the PIMS Restoration Movement had a meeting with Minister for Law Zahid Hamid to discuss the current status of the bill. The Law Minister told his secretary to table the bill for the PM’s approval, given that there are no reservations now on behalf of any of the stakeholders. “When the summary was last sent to the PM, the Ministry of Finance, which had already vetted the bill before sending it to the PM, came up with some minute observations, which triggered unwarranted delays,” the media spokesperson of the movement Dr. Asfandyar Khan recollected.
Dr. Tariq Fazal confirmed that all observations on the bill have been rectified and that efforts are being made to have it tabled in the currently ongoing session of the Parliament. “The PM has, in principle, agreed to separation of PIMS from SZABMU, and the process is expected to be completed soon,” he stated, urging the protestors to immediately call of their strike in the interest of patient care.
The protestors, however, displayed no laxity in their stance. In a meeting convened late in the evening, they decided to continue the strike till their longstanding demand is met. “We have succumbed to the government’s hollow promises in the past and have learnt our lesson all too well. We cannot be deceived yet again,” Dr. Asfandyar maintained.
Meanwhile, JI leader Mian Muhammad Aslam and CDA representative Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin also expressed solidarity with the protesters by joining them at PIMS. “Unity in your ranks will leave the government with no other option but to pass the amendment bill. You have the power to get it done. We will not surrender PIMS to any force,” the JI leader stated.",1.0288000106811523,0,1

The situation escalated when Dr. Akram attempted to address the crowd, leading to a heated exchange that resulted in his removal from the premises by security personnel.

"There’s nothing like a good night’s sleep to prepare us for the new day. But sadly many people aren’t getting one.
New research* reveals that the average Brit wakes up three times during the night, and for one in 10 of us it’s 7 to 10 times.
Here’s 10 reasons people say they can’t get a good night’s sleep.
1. Going to the toilet
Nearly half those surveyed (47%) have to get up to use the loo during the night. This happens more often if we’ve had liquids before going to bed, and functions as nature’s own little alarm clock. Unfortunately, it usually goes off around 3am…
2. Being woken up by discomfort
A bad back or even general aches and pains are keeping 19% of us awake at night.
3. Snoring
A hefty 41% of us fed up of having to poke our other halves until they turn over.
4. Being edged out
A sizeable 25% of us wake up to find ourselves occupying a sliver of space on the edge of the bed, as our partners have managed to occupy our side as well as theirs.
5. Tossing and turning
This affects 10.5% of us too, whether it’s us doing it, or our partners.
6. Bedroom talk
10% of us have to put up with our partner talking, or making other weird noises, in their sleep
7. Phone problems
10% of us are woken up by our partner looking at their phone, because no matter what manufacturers say, the light that emits from them at night is still enough to wake people up.
8. Brought to book 4.6% of us are woken by a partner who is watching TV or reading (presumably because they can’t get to sleep).
9. Bad dreams or nightmares
These affect 11% of us - and who hasn’t woken up sweating about the bogeyman under the bed?
10. Plain old anxiety
This affects 6% of us. We’re worrying about the next day at work, bills, relationships, waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to get back to sleep...
The survey of 2,000 British adults was carried out by mattress company Tweak Mattress (tweakmattress.com).
Psychologist Robert Stewart said: “There are two main reasons our sleep is good or poor, and these are our sleep hygiene and our sleep cycles.
“Sleep hygiene relates to our ‘before-bed’ routine. Not drinking or eating a lot, choosing the same time to sleep each night, and not looking at phones, laptops or TV in bed, to name a few.
“Getting these right should help in getting you off to sleep, but more importantly, there are the sleep cycles you go through.
“A person will go through 5 stages of sleep in a night and each of these vary in depth.
“Stage 5 or rapid eye movement (REM) stage is the lightest stage of sleep and this is where people are most likely to stir.
“Whilst we cannot control this, the surrounding environment, such as a partner snoring, other noise or discomfort, will impact on whether we return to sleep smoothly or are awoken.
“So to drift back to sleep seamlessly and without disturbance, ensure you have the best environment to aid this, whether it be earplugs or a comfortable mattress.”",0.9680365324020386,0,1
"...feeling tired and unrested, with nearly 60% reporting that they struggle to get a full night’s sleep. The study, conducted by the Sleep Foundation, found that factors such as stress, screen time, and irregular sleep schedules are major contributors to this widespread issue. 

Participants indicated that they typically get less than seven hours of sleep per night, falling short of the recommended eight hours for optimal health. Alarmingly, 40% of respondents admitted to using their phones or tablets right before bed, which can disrupt the body’s natural sleep cycle due to blue light exposure.

Experts emphasize the importance of establishing a bedtime routine and creating a sleep-friendly environment to combat these challenges. Simple changes, such as reducing screen time in the evening and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, can significantly improve sleep quality. As the nation grapples with sleep deprivation, prioritizing rest may be the key to enhancing overall well-being and productivity.",0.6684861779212952,1,1

When Martavis Bryant returned to practice this weekend, that left one wide receiver to get on the practice field with the Steelers.
If Sammie Coates has his wish, that number will be zero Wednesday.
Coates is targeting the team's next practice — Tuesday is an off day — as when he will be activated from the physically unable to perform list.
“I hope this week, Wednesday. Who knows?” Coates said Monday afternoon. “I'm just hoping. I'm getting ready to get out there.”
Coates began training camp on the PUP list as the result of knee surgery he had during the summer. His work has been limited to running and catching passes on a field adjacent to where the Steelers are practicing. Until Sunday, Coates had Bryant by his side.
“He's working. He's getting close,” coach Mike Tomlin said. “We'll see what it looks like when we come out of the off day.”
When he returns, Coates will be among nine other wide receivers competing for six (possibly seven) roster spots.
“This is a really good group,” he said. “We've got a lot of playmakers out there. It's going to be fun to see how it turns out.”
Coates doesn't think his production in the first five weeks of 2016 (19 catches for 421 yards and two touchdowns) will be as important as what he does over the next month of preseason games.
“Last year was last year,” he said. “You have to prove yourself every year. You can't just show up and hope that counts. It doesn't work that way.”
Ready to run
James Conner reiterated his desire to play in the second preseason game, which is Sunday afternoon against the Atlanta Falcons. The rookie running back hasn't taken part in a padded practice since the first one of training camp. That could change Wednesday.
“In my mind, I want to play Sunday,” Conner said. “Come game day if I feel it (in the shoulder), I'll be smart.”
Conner practiced extensively Monday in a non-padded practice. That came on the heels of 7-on-7 work Sunday. Although his return to practice has been slow, Conner doesn't think he needs to play catchup to Fitzgerald Toussaint, Knile Davis and the other running backs getting regular work.
“I don't feel like I'm getting further behind at all,” he said. “Throughout the game and practice, I stay on (running backs) coach (James) Saxon's hip. The mental reps help tremendously. I'm good with the playbook, and I don't feel behind at all.”
Faked out
For the second time in as many years, a social media post was attributed to James Harrison stating his contempt for players who don't stand for the national anthem.
For the second year in a row, the post was from a fake account and never issued by the Steelers linebacker.
The faux post surfaced Sunday after Michael Bennett and his former Seattle teammate, Marshawn Lynch, did not stand for the anthem before their respective games.
“Anyone on my team sits for Anthem, they better be in a wheelchair,” read the post attributed to Harrison.
Trouble was, Harrison didn't write it, just like early last season when he was reported to have tweeted, “If you on my team and not standin for Anthem better be from a broken leg or I'm gonna give you one.”
Harrison used his verified Instagram account Monday to scold anyone who was fooled by the report.
“Said it last year & I'll say it again. Fact check before you go running your mouth! Just cause it's on social media don't make it true. #fakenews”
Roster move
The Steelers addressed the shortage of healthy outside linebackers by signing Austin Gearing, a converted quarterback from Miami (Ohio). Gearing, who is 6-foot-4 and 250 pounds, was inserted into the rotation Monday during practice.
Because of injuries, the Steelers had only veteran Arthur Moats, rookie first-rounder T.J. Watt and first-year player Farrington Huguenin available for the preseason opener Friday against the New York Giants.
“We had to fortify the depth there,” Tomlin said.
Wide receiver Canaan Severin was waived to make room for Gearing.

"...As the team gears up for the upcoming season, Bryant's return is a significant boost for the Steelers' offense. His speed and playmaking ability have been sorely missed, and his presence on the field could open up opportunities for other receivers. With the departure of veteran players, the coaching staff is eager to see how the younger wideouts will step up in their roles.

During practice, Bryant showcased his trademark agility and route-running skills, impressing both coaches and teammates alike. ""It feels great to be back out there,"" Bryant said. ""I've been working hard to get back into game shape, and I’m ready to contribute."" 

The Steelers are also keeping a close eye on their rookie receivers, who are vying for a spot on the final roster. With the preseason approaching, every practice session is crucial for these players to prove their worth and secure their place in the lineup. The competition is fierce, and the stakes are high as the team prepares for a challenging season ahead.",0.6820788383483887,1,1
"All the major technology companies have strict policies prohibiting harassment and other bullying behaviour on their services, but primarily rely on users to report abuses and weed them out.
Representation pic
Melania Trump is hosting executives from major online and social media companies to discuss cyberbullying and internet safety, more than a year after saying that would be her issue as first lady. The meeting today marks her first public event on the topic, a choice some observers have questioned given that her husband often berates people on Twitter. Amazon, Snap, Facebook, Google and Twitter are among the companies that are expected to attend the meeting. The Internet Association said it will also be represented.
All the major technology companies have strict policies prohibiting harassment and other bullying behaviour on their services, but primarily rely on users to report abuses and weed them out. They try to clearly spell out the kinds of remarks and other posts that won't be tolerated in special sections such as one Facebook, the largest online social network, has set up. Instagram, a popular service among kids and young adults for sharing photos and videos, provides links to the US government's anti-bullying site and tips from a cyberbullying research center on one of its help pages.
But the efforts so far have fallen short, leading to rampant abuses that even some of the companies acknowledge have driven away or tormented portions of their audience. It got so bad on Twitter, which has 68 million US users, that the San Francisco company vowed last fall to crack down on hateful tweets. Among other things, Twitter adopted new policies aimed at protecting women who unknowingly or unwillingly had nude pictures of themselves distributed online a common bullying tactic.
Yik Yak, another messaging app once popular among high school and college students, shut down last year partly because schools banned it following complaints about bullying and harassment. Online bullying takes many shapes, but some of the most common tactics include posting embarrassing or salacious photos, making demeaning or cruel remarks under a photo or in a general post about someone, and sharing screenshots of what at least one person thought was a private text.
Harassment is widespread and extends beyond teenagers. A Pew Research Center poll last year found 41 percent of US adults believed they had been harassed online. The popularity of and volume of content on major social media sites presents a huge challenge in policing what is being shared. Facebook, for instance, has 2.1 billion worldwide users who collectively share billions of posts on their pages daily. More than 300 hours of video is uploaded to Google's YouTube site every minute.
The companies are also constantly struggling to balance the desire to prevent harassment and other abuses and maintain a commitment to freedom of expression. In some cases, they see harassment and still look the other way. For instance, some of President Trump's more vitriolic tweets have openly mocked and denigrated people, prompting calls for Twitter to shut down his account and ban him from its service. But Twitter has declined, maintaining the news value of the president's tweets eclipse complaints about him being a bully.
There is no federal law that applies to bullying. State laws vary, ranging from requiring public schools to have a bullying policy to requiring anonymous reporting systems, said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University. The federal government can best help by giving schools more tools and money to provide programs, Hinduja said. Trump announced in a speech near the end of the 2016 presidential campaign that her priority as first lady would be to fight cyberbullying. A native of Slovenia, she at the time lamented a US culture that she said had grown ""too mean and too rough."" It was a curious speech for a woman whose husband uses Twitter to dismiss people as losers and taunt them with unflattering nicknames.
The mother of a 12-year-old son, the first lady has made child well-being her focus in the White House, including an unexpected interest in how the opioid crisis is affecting youngsters. She has visited hospitals and care centers to see the effects first hand, and has embraced parents whose children died from drug overdoses. She accompanied the president to New Hampshire on Monday as he discussed a three-pronged effort to combat drug addiction, including applying the death penalty against those caught trafficking highly addictive substances. Mrs. Trump recently asked the spouses of US governors to help promote values such as encouragement, kindness, compassion and respect in children. She has also spoken about limiting the amount of time children spend online, and helping them understand the content they are exposed to.

"...of marginalized groups in tech has been a focal point in discussions about online safety. Many advocates argue that without diverse voices in decision-making roles, policies may not adequately address the unique challenges faced by different communities. Recent studies have shown that platforms with more inclusive teams are better equipped to understand and mitigate harassment issues.

Moreover, the effectiveness of reporting mechanisms is often questioned. Users frequently express frustration over the slow response times and perceived ineffectiveness of these systems. Critics suggest that technology companies need to invest more in proactive measures, such as AI-driven monitoring tools, to identify and address harmful behavior before it escalates.

As the conversation around online safety continues to evolve, tech giants are under increasing pressure to not only enforce their policies but also to foster a culture of respect and inclusivity.

"You don't have to be lost when it comes to fashion. Maybe you need a guiding hand, and there are plenty of resources available. Once you start to gain some solid information regarding fashion, you will be well on your way to expressing your individual interests when it comes to fashion in today's society.
If you are starting to go gray, try using a vegetable dye. As long as it is just a few strands that are causing anxiety, this product should do the trick. It turns the gray a shade that is a tad lighter than the rest of your hair. Using vegetable dye will make it look as though you have nice, new highlights and will then fade out over about three months.
Lip gloss is a girl's best friend! There is nothing worse than dry, chapped, uncomfortable-feeling lips. That's where a pretty gloss comes in! Whether you like the super-glossy look or something a little more subdued, lip gloss is a great way to keep your lips looking and feeling their best throughout the day.

Using vegetable dye will make it look as though you have nice, new highlights and will then fade out over about three months.
When selecting a dress, choose one that has a vertical (rather than horizontal) pattern. This makes you appear longer rather than wider, giving the illusion that you are slimmer than you really are. Also, seek out a piece that has an empire waist, as it makes it seem like you have a smaller waistline.
Hats are a great accessory to match any kind of outfit. For men, there are the typical fisherman hats and baseball caps, but for women, the possibilities run much deeper. For instance, you can wear a cute sun hat, floppy hat or beach hat with any casual dress you own.
The color of your skin should determine what color clothing you should wear. If you are very pale, avoid colors that will make you appear paler, like beiges, yellows and whites. On the other hand, if you have darker skin, lighter colors, like light blues, pinks and yellows will compliment your skin.
Don't fall for a fashion trend if it doesn't fit your frame well. Everyone may be wearing the newest fashion fad, and you'll be tempted to follow suit. But if the newest style is not complementary to your physical frame, you will only be doing yourself a fashion disservice.
Neutrals are big every season. This season, the creamier neutrals are especially popular. Try looking for pieces in hues like cream, caramel, chocolate, etc. These colors work well on their own, and they also work as accents to bold or subdued outfits. Whichever way you decide to flaunt them, you can find some neutrals that go with your outfits.
Dress for your body type. Take the time to understand your shape, and how to use clothes to enhance your natural assets. Women who know how to work with their body, instead of hiding it, are the ones people notice when they walk into a room. Be proud of your shape, and work with it to boost your fashion esteem.
If you are in your 40's or older, know that you can still fashionable for your age. This does not mean that you should dress the way you did when you are 20, but you can make wise fashion choices. For middle-aged women, V-neck tops with cardigans or blazers with a pair of dress pants is a nice look.
Probably the most important tip is to always be comfortable in whatever you are wearing. You may be wearing the most glamorous dress at a party, but if you aren't comfortable in this dress, people are going to notice. This is why you should pick out an item that feels good on you. Do not forget to smile and let your personality shine through!
When you get a haircut, keep your face shape in mind. Certain face shapes look better with certain hairstyles. Oval faces look great with nearly any hairstyle, while round faces do better with hairstyles that have height. Pear faces look better with round cuts and triangular faces look better with short cuts. Square faces look great with all kinds of cuts, except those that are flat on top.
One great piece of fashion advice is to make sure that you check yourself from all angles before walking out your door. This is important because you do not want to be embarrassed due to either a strange fit, a stain, or leaving a tag on. Have someone else to check for you as well, if possible.
For a fun and simple daytime look, wear your hair in a casual up-do. Use an accessory that coordinates with your outfit to hold most of your hair in place. Allow some gentle pieces to fall out and frame your face. You will feel cooler, and look casually appealing to everyone!
Wear modern glasses. Many people overlook their glasses when trying to look chic. When it is necessary to wear glasses, you have another opportunity to showcase your fashion knowledge. Try different shapes and sizes to see which ones accentuate your face best.
When purchasing a jacket or coat, you should take note of the number of buttons. The buttons on a coat jacket should never exceed three. Furthermore, a jacket with three buttons should only have the top-most button buttoned. This is an easy step to take that will keep you looking fashionable all day long.

"The Pentagon has not discussed which missile blew up ""almost immediately"" after launch early Sunday from near Sinpo on the North's east coast, and the White House has said only that it was a medium-range device.
[WASHINGTON] The latest North Korean missile launch may have been of a new and hitherto unknown system being developed by Kim Jong Un's regime, a weapons expert said Monday.
The Pentagon has not discussed which missile blew up ""almost immediately"" after launch early Sunday from near Sinpo on the North's east coast, and the White House has said only that it was a medium-range device.
John Schilling, a weapons expert with the 38 North monitoring group, said the launch failure was indicative of a new systems test.
""The discussion of it failing very early in launch, that's a common failure mode for North Korean missiles very early on in their development cycle when they are working out the bugs in the propulsion and guidance system,"" Mr Schilling told AFP.
sentifi.com Market voices on:
""More detail would always be nice. But I am going to suspect that this was a new missile or certainly one that has not been well-developed.""
Anonymous US officials told Fox News the missile was a new type of Scud called the KN-17 - a single-stage, liquid-fueled missile - that could be used to target ships.
Mr Schilling thought the test could have been of a new design that Kim showed off in a massive military parade Saturday in Pyongyang.
That missile was being carried on a Musudan intermediate-range ballistic missile transporter, but was a different type of device, Mr Schilling said.
""That's something that we've never seen tested. If they are trying to demonstrate that as a real capability, it would make sense for them to test it as soon as possible after showing it to the world.""
Susan Thornton, acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said it was difficult to glean much information given how quickly the rocket failed.
""Our understanding is that it was not one of the longer-range missiles that they were trying to test there. It was something like a medium-range ballistic missile but still with prohibited technology, but it's still an object of ongoing discussion,"" Ms Thornton said.
NUCLEAR REVIEW
Sunday's launch failure led some observers to speculate that US hacking efforts might have played a role.
The New York Times last month reported that under former president Barack Obama the US stepped up cyber attacks against North Korea to try to sabotage its missiles before launch or just as they lift off.
Britain's former Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told the BBC ""there is a very strong belief that the US - through cyber methods - has been successful on several occasions in interrupting these sorts of tests and making them fail."" But Mr Schilling said the ability to hack North Korea's missiles is overblown.
""From what we know of North Korean missiles, the propulsion technology in particular is fairly primitive with no digital or electronics to be hacked,"" said Mr Schilling.
The 38 North programme is part of the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Washington.
Also Monday, Pentagon chief Jim Mattis ordered the start of a review of America's nuclear deterrent to ensure it is ""safe, secure, effective, reliable and appropriately tailored to deter 21st-century threats and reassure our allies,"" officials said.
Such reviews take place every seven years or so.
AFP",1.0268863439559937,0,1
"""...that it is monitoring the situation closely. Officials have indicated that the missile test appears to be part of North Korea's ongoing efforts to advance its military capabilities, despite international sanctions and diplomatic efforts aimed at denuclearization.

The launch comes amid heightened tensions in the region, with North Korea conducting a series of missile tests in recent months. Analysts suggest that these tests are intended to demonstrate the regime's resolve and technological advancements, particularly in the face of perceived threats from the United States and its allies.

In response to the latest launch, South Korea's military has reiterated its commitment to maintaining a robust defense posture and has called for a united international response to North Korea's provocations. The U.S. has also reaffirmed its defense commitments to South Korea and Japan, emphasizing the importance of regional stability and security.""",0.6075624227523804,1,1
"Bella Hadid seemed low-spirited during Valentine’s Day as her former beau was seen making out with Selena Gomez on a yacht in Los Angeles. The model was seen rocking her chunky boots and a black top and jacket — quite the opposite of Valentine’s Day colors.
Her former boyfriend and herself had dated for more than a year and it was claimed that their split was cordial and friendly. While some people do their best to avoid their exes, these two are in an industry where they are more than likely to bump into each other. They were seen together again, despite breaking up, at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show where they acted amicable; during his performance she rocked the runway straight past him. Of course it didn’t hurt that she looked her best and was completely unfazed by her former love.
2017 is Bella’s year
The runway star continues to get more and more ad campaigns. She rocked the New York Fashion Week runways and managed to close the Oscar de la Renta show. She was emotional in her Prabal Gurung show as it was an empowering tribute to feminists. She wore a T-shirt with the word, “The Future Is Female” and “I am an immigrant.”
The model doesn’t have to worry about her ex’s actions and doings as she focuses on her big year. Gigi Hadid’s younger sister landed collaboration with luxury Swiss watch brand TAG Heuer. The 20-year-old became their official brand ambassador and she’s joined by the likes of DJ David Guetta, football player Cristiano Ronaldo, actor Chris Hemsworth, and more.
I don't stop, I don't crumble and I certainly #DontCrackUnderPressure ! Thank you Tag for the warm welcome to the family and making me the new face of @tagheuer ! ????❌⏱❤ by my lil birdie @cassblackbird ❤ A post shared by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Feb 13, 2017 at 1:03pm PST
Moving on
The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, seems to have completely moved on from his model ex to singer Selena Gomez. The two had apparently been dating for months but only recently made their love for each other more public with their public affections for each other.
The “Good for you” singer, according to TMZ, most recently spoiled her man on his 27th birthday. She may not have attended the party thrown for her beau but she apparently spent nearly $30,000 on the bill. The party was attended by the likes of French Montana, 2 Chainz, Travis Scott, and more.
Bella Hadid spoke with Teen Vogue and revealed that it was her first breakup and it was difficult.
“It was my first breakup or second, next to the horse and so public. As an outsider, you might think I handled it so well, but it’s always in your heart, and you always feel it very heavily,”
The 2016 model of the year is on the cover of February 2017 Teen Vogue issue. She also talked about dealing with Lyme disease aside from her breakup.
She did reiterate that despite having a broken heart and that “love hurts,” she knows that it would be hard but one has to pull through. The model shared that she would always have love and respect for the Weeknd.
Unlike Bella, Justin Bieber has been showing another side of himself when it came to moving on. The star, when asked by TMZ about the Weeknd, simply said that the hit maker’s music was “wack.”
Justin, who is Selena’s former girlfriend, has been in love with the musician for many years despite dating a variety of models and other women for the years that they’ve been apart. Unlike Bella who has only shown positivity, the “Cold Water” singer has been rude and poking at the singer.
Bieber most recently took to Instagram live to share his disdain. The Weeknd’s music was playing in the background and Bieber said it was his favorite song at the moment before bursting into laughter.

"Audi’s e-tron prototype, the forerunner of its coming series-production battery-electric SUV, features a drag coefficient of 0.28—a top result in the SUV segment. The figure is a decisive factor in the everyday range of more than 400 kilometers (248.5 mi) in the WLTP cycle; a hundredth of the drag coefficient figure represents a range of around five kilometers (3.1 mi) driving under everyday conditions, Audi says.
On the aeroacoustics test rig in the Wind Tunnel Center in Ingolstadt—the world’s quietest vehicle wind tunnel—Audi engineers optimize drag and noise under extreme conditions. With an output of 2.6 MW, the fan produces speeds of up to 300 km/h (186.4 mph). The Audi e-tron prototype was put through more than 1,000 hours of testing here.
To achieve the drag coefficient of 0.28, the Audi engineers developed a wide range of aerodynamics measures in all body areas. Some of these technical solutions are evident at first glance, while others fulfill their purpose hidden away from sight.
With these solutions, the drag coefficient for the Audi e-tron prototype is almost 0.07 less than for a comparable, conventionally powered vehicle. With a typical usage profile this set-up increases the range by around 35 kilometers (21.7 mi) per battery charge in the WLTP cycle.
Virtual exterior mirrors and dimples on the underbody. The optional virtual exterior mirrors will be making their world premiere in the volume-production version of the Audi e-tron prototype. They are much narrower than the standard mirrors: They reduce the vehicle width by 15 centimeters (5.9 in) and, given their new shape, not only reduce drag, but also noticeably cut the nonetheless low wind noise.
Each of their flat supports integrates a small camera. The captured images appear on OLED displays in the transition between the instrument panel and door. The virtual exterior mirrors can be adapted for various driving situations, thus potentially improving safety. Three views are available in the MMI system: for highway driving, turning and parking.
Another important factor is the standard adaptive air suspension—a pneumatic suspension with adjustable damping. At speeds above 120 km/h (74.6 mph), it lowers the body by up to 26 millimeters (1.0 in) below the normal position, thus reducing the drag. The underbody of the all-electric SUV is fully enclosed; the front and rear area are fully paneled.
Underneath the passenger cell, an aluminum plate protects the high-voltage battery against damage from below, such as stone chipping or curbs. Its bolting points come with bowl-shaped indentations, similar to the dimples on a golf ball. They make the air flow much better than a totally flat surface.
The controllable cool-air inlet – a frame behind the Singleframe with two electrically operated louvers—also helps lower drag. When shut, the air in this area flows with virtually no swirl. As soon as the drivetrain components need cooling or the air conditioning condenser requires ventilation, the top louver opens first and then both louvers. When the hydraulic wheel brakes are subject to high loads, the controllable cool-air inlet opens and releases two ducts which channel the cooling air into the front wheel arches to the brakes.
The side air inlets at the front of the Audi e-tron prototype incorporate additional ducts, which are clearly visible from outside, to the wheel arches. They channel the airstream so that it flows past the outside of the standard aerodynamically optimized 19-inch wheels. Their design is flatter than with conventional wheels. The 255/55 size tires stand out with their ultralow rolling resistance. Even the tire sidewalls add to the aerodynamic design—the lettering is negative instead of raised.",0.998353898525238,0,1
"...enhancing the vehicle's efficiency and range. A lower drag coefficient means that the e-tron can cut through the air more effectively, reducing energy consumption and extending the distance it can travel on a single charge. This aerodynamic design is complemented by a sleek silhouette and innovative features such as active grille shutters that adjust based on speed and cooling needs.

The e-tron prototype also showcases advanced technologies, including a sophisticated all-wheel-drive system that optimizes traction and stability in various driving conditions. Inside, the cabin is equipped with high-quality materials and cutting-edge infotainment systems, ensuring a luxurious experience for passengers.

Audi aims to position the e-tron as a leader in the electric SUV market, competing with established players while appealing to environmentally conscious consumers. With a focus on performance, sustainability, and technology, the e-tron is set to redefine expectations for electric vehicles in the luxury segment.",0.6519471406936646,1,1
"PARKLAND, Fla. — A Marjory Stoneman Douglas student alleges he was aggressively questioned by school administrators and local law enforcement after posting on social media that he fired an assault weapon at a gun range with his dad.
Junior Kyle Kashuv said he was brought in for questioning Monday by a school security officer and a Broward County deputy in what he says was an attempt to intimidate him.
It was great learning about our inalienable right of #2A and how to properly use a gun. This was my first time ever touching a gun and it made me appreciate the #Constitution even more. My instructor was very informative; I learnt a lot. #2A is important and we need 2 preserve 2A pic.twitter.com/4rcOZbpl88 — Kyle Kashuv (@KyleKashuv) April 21, 2018
“I can now check off being wrongfully questioned by law enforcement off my bucket list,” tweeted Kashuv, adding “school will be interesting for the remainder of my tenure at MSD. I am not looking forward to it.”
On Tuesday, Kashuv told Fox News host Tucker Carlson that the meeting with officials was an interrogation.
“It was a clear attempt to intimidate me, and they used very, very, very harsh intimidation tactics,” Kashuv said.
#ICYMI check out part of my interview with an anti-gun control Parkland teen who says he was interrogated ""like a criminal"" for visiting a gun range. pic.twitter.com/OKE0TMboUb — Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) April 25, 2018
After first being questioned by a school security officer, a Broward County deputy entered the room and sat behind the teen, Kashuv said. The deputy began asking Kashuv who the rifle belonged to and who he went shooting with. Kashuv said he asked if he could record the interview and was told that he couldn’t. The teen said he felt like the deputy was trying to get him to incriminate his father.
Kashuv said the gun debate has become so prominent since the Valentine’s Day massacre that killed 17 that he “felt it was important to learn about the physical mechanics of it,” Kashuv said in a text to The Associated Press. “I made sure to post about it because I wanted to show people it’s people that are the issue, not guns.”
Kashuv also tweeted “Apparently using my constitutional rights to learn how to defend myself is wrong? Sorry, I thought this was still the United States of America.”
On Friday, Kashuv posted videos on Twitter showing him firing an AR-15 rifle at a target, saying it “strengthened my love for 2A” and taught him “America is the greatest country ever, where freedom intensifies and liberty is required to be a real American.”
His posts came as thousands of students around the country walked out of school for gun reform in honour of the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting.
Kashuv has been a vocal supporter of gun rights and garnered heavy support from conservative pro-gun groups. The teen has drawn criticism from the core #NeverAgain students, including Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg, who have repeatedly called for a ban on assault rifles.
A Broward Sheriff’s Office incident report confirmed the meeting, but didn’t provide any specific response to Kashuv’s claim that the deputy used interrogation techniques against him.
A school security supervisor told the deputy several students had expressed concern about the social media post, even though no threats were on the video, the report said.
When asked about the post, Kashuv said he had borrowed the rifle from a friend and went shooting with his father, the report said. Officials contacted Kashuv’s mother, who stated she knew about the video and the trip to the gun range.",0.9598603844642639,0,1

According to the student, he was pulled from class and questioned for over an hour about his intentions and access to firearms. ""I felt like I was being treated like a criminal for just sharing a hobby,"" he said. The incident has sparked a debate about the balance between safety and freedom of expression in schools, especially in the wake of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018.

"fongbeerredhot/ShutterstockIf you’re a smoker and you’re not yet thinking about quitting, you need to think again. If the fact that smoking ruins your looks isn’t reason enough to quit, how about the fact that it could kill you? Smoking can exacerbate diabetes because it raises your blood sugar. Smoking is responsible for nearly half of all liver cancers. And quitting smoking decreases your risk of a cardiovascular disease by 50 percent after just one year. Hey, look, why don’t we just agree that “smoking is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and premature mortality worldwide,” which was how an esteemed group of scholars from the United Kingdom introduced the findings of their recent study in the scientific journal Thorax, which demonstrated that undergoing lung cancer screening—in the form of a CT scan—may push smokers to finally kick the habit.
The study, led by researchers at Cardiff University working with the University of Liverpool’s Institute of Translational Medicine, King’s College London and Queen Mary University of London, added to the already mounting evidence that participating in lung cancer screening significantly increases the rate at which people quit smoking, at least among those already “motivated and receptive” to the idea of quitting. It also confirms the findings of previous trials that a clean bill of health from a lung cancer screening does not falsely reassure smokers or reduce their motivation to stop smoking.
For the study, the researchers sent information packs to a random sampling of nearly 2.5 million British residents ages 50 to 75. The packs included a self-report questionnaire regarding lung cancer risk factors. From the questionnaire responders, 8,729 patients were identified as being at high risk for lung cancer. After they completed a second questionnaire to identify trial eligibility (among other things, people had to be smokers to be eligible) those who got the green light were either invited to participate in screening via CT scan or not, although all of those deemed eligible were offered standard leaflets and other information on how to quit smoking.
Crunching the numbers after following up at two weeks and then again at two years, the researchers found 10 percent of the people who had been screened had quit after two weeks, and 15 percent after two years—both higher than the 5 percent rates found in the group that had not been invited to participate in screening.
Although smokers who quit after their screenings credited the screening with their quitting, the voluntary nature of the trial meant that smokers who took part were “self-selected and may already have been contemplating quitting,” the study authors note. That said, through the questionnaires, those who ended up quitting did have a marginal tendency toward feeling distressed over their smoking, which suggests that “experiencing a degree of concern about lung cancer may be necessary to galvanize cessation.” Future evaluations of CT lung screening would therefore benefit from examining the influence of both mood and smoking-related thoughts and perceptions on quitting outcomes.
For now, the British researchers are confident in concluding that “CT lung cancer screening for high-risk participants offers a teachable moment for smoking cessation” and that for doctors and policymakers who are considering adding lung cancer screening to smoking cessation initiatives, this study adds to evidence suggesting that integrating CT screening with [other anti-smoking] interventions could really help smokers who are motivated to quit.

"...about the serious health risks associated with smoking? Research consistently shows that smoking is linked to a range of life-threatening conditions, including heart disease, stroke, and various types of cancer. Each puff not only damages your lungs but also accelerates the aging process, leading to premature wrinkles and a dull complexion. 

Moreover, secondhand smoke poses significant risks to those around you, particularly children and pets, increasing their chances of developing respiratory issues and other health problems. 

Quitting smoking can dramatically improve your health and quality of life. Within just a few days of stopping, your body begins to heal, and your risk of heart disease decreases.

"First 3D printed human corneas
The first human corneas have been 3D printed by scientists at Newcastle University.
It means the technique could be used in the future to ensure an unlimited supply of corneas.
As the outermost layer of the human eye, the cornea has an important role in focusing vision.
Yet there is a significant shortage of corneas available to transplant, with 10 million people worldwide requiring surgery to prevent corneal blindness as a result of diseases such as trachoma, an infectious eye disorder.
In addition, almost 5 million people suffer total blindness due to corneal scarring caused by burns, lacerations, abrasion or disease.
The proof-of-concept research, published today in Experimental Eye Research, reports how stem cells (human corneal stromal cells) from a healthy donor cornea were mixed together with alginate and collagen to create a solution that could be printed, a ‘bio-ink’.
Using a simple low-cost 3D bio-printer, the bio-ink was successfully extruded in concentric circles to form the shape of a human cornea. It took less than 10 minutes to print.
The stem cells were then shown to culture – or grow.
Che Connon, Professor of Tissue Engineering at Newcastle University, who led the work, said: “Many teams across the world have been chasing the ideal bio-ink to make this process feasible. “Our unique gel – a combination of alginate and collagen – keeps the stem cells alive whilst producing a material which is stiff enough to hold its shape but soft enough to be squeezed out the nozzle of a 3D printer.
“This builds upon our previous work in which we kept cells alive for weeks at room temperature within a similar hydrogel. Now we have a ready to use bio-ink containing stem cells allowing users to start printing tissues without having to worry about growing the cells separately.”
The scientists, including first author and PhD student Ms Abigail Isaacson from the Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University, also demonstrated that they could build a cornea to match a patient’s unique specifications.
The dimensions of the printed tissue were originally taken from an actual cornea. By scanning a patient’s eye, they could use the data to rapidly print a cornea which matched the size and shape. Professor Connon added: “Our 3D printed corneas will now have to undergo further testing and it will be several years before we could be in the position where we are using them for transplants. “However, what we have shown is that it is feasible to print corneas using coordinates taken from a patient eye and that this approach has potential to combat the world-wide shortage.”

"...that patients with corneal blindness have access to personalized and readily available transplants. The breakthrough, achieved using a bio-ink made from human cells, allows for the creation of corneas that closely mimic the natural structure and function of the eye. Researchers believe this innovation could significantly reduce the reliance on donor corneas, which are in short supply globally.

The 3D printing process involves layering the bio-ink to form a cornea that can be shaped to fit individual patients' needs. This technology not only has the potential to improve the quality of life for those suffering from vision impairment but also opens the door to further advancements in regenerative medicine. 

Clinical trials are expected to begin in the coming years, with hopes that this method could eventually lead to widespread availability of 3D printed corneas. The team at Newcastle University is optimistic that their work will pave the way for similar techniques in other organ transplants.",0.7383367419242859,1,1

"Darren Osborne drove a van into a crowd outside a mosque in London last June.
He killed one person and injured nine others.
He was sentenced to 43 years in prison at Woolwich Crown Court.
The man who drove a van into a crowd outside two London mosques last year has been sentenced to 43 years in prison.
Darren Osborne, 48, killed one man and injured nine others after he swerved into worshippers at Finsbury Park, north London, at 12.16 a.m. last June.
Osborne was said to have shouted ""I want to kill all Muslims"" shortly after the attack.
He was found guilty of murder and attempted murder on Thursday, and sentenced at Woolwich Crown Court on Friday afternoon.
The judge sentenced him to life in prison, with a minimum term of 43 years.
Reporters in court described Osborne as emotionless. He is also reported to have said ""God bless you, thank you,"" as he was taken away.
Judge: ""The diversity of the group you tried to kill is striking... old people... young people... deaf people... men and women... you targeted them because of how they looked... the medical and emotional impact is severe."" #FinsburyPark — Joe Tidy (@joetidy) February 2, 2018
The family of Makram Ali, the man whom Osborne killed, said that they were ""pleased"" with the verdict after the trauma of the attack and seeing him in court for weeks on end.
Ruzina Akhtar, one of Ali's children, told reporters outside court: ""The last few months have been very hard for our family as we have tried to adjust to life without our father.
""It was particularly hard for us to sit in court and listen to Darren Osborne deny he had done anything wrong. We are very pleased with the guilty verdict.""
She described Ali as ""a peaceful and simple man"" who ""had no bad thoughts for anyone.""
She said: ""Our father, like the victims of most terrorism, was entirely innocent, which makes his death in this violent way all the more hurtful.
""We cannot imagine the trauma he felt in his last few minutes. But we choose to remember our father with happier thoughts. He will never be forgotten.""
During the trial, the lead prosecutor said Osborne had been ""brainwashed"" into Islamophobia after watching a BBC drama about an underage sex grooming gang run by Muslim men in Rochdale, Manchester.
During his trial, Osborne also claimed that he wanted to kill Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at a pro-Palestinian march in London.
The London Metropolitan Police on Thursday released a 15-second clip of the scene as Osborne drove into a crowd of people in Muslim dress that night.
The force also released a series of CCTV stills that showed how he planned the attack in Wales before driving to London to carry out the deadly act.
Commander Dean Haydon, the head of the Met's counterterrorism unit, said on Thursday: ""If Osborne’s aim was to create divisions and hate between communities, then from what I have seen, he has failed in that respect.
""The way that the local community in Finsbury Park — of all faiths and backgrounds — came together was astounding and this reaction was the same across London and the UK.""",0.9529085755348206,0,1
"prison for his actions. The attack, which took place during Ramadan, was described as a deliberate act of terrorism motivated by hatred towards Muslims. The victim, Makram Ali, was a 51-year-old father of three who was attending evening prayers when the van struck. 

During the trial, Osborne showed no remorse for his actions, and evidence presented revealed that he had been influenced by extremist views and online propaganda. The incident sparked widespread condemnation and led to increased security measures at places of worship across the UK. 

Community leaders and politicians called for unity and resilience in the face of hate, emphasizing the importance of standing together against such acts of violence. In the aftermath, vigils were held to honor the victims and promote messages of peace and tolerance, highlighting the need for continued dialogue and understanding among different communities.",0.6909207701683044,1,1

'I'm married to a Texan and it is a very different world': Nicole recently spoke candidly about the impact of her most famous photo shoot where she was pictured breastfeeding son Zion on the cover of Elle Australia, two years ago
Nicole recently spoke candidly about the impact of her most famous photo shoot where she was pictured breastfeeding son Zion on the cover of Elle Australia, two years ago.
Nicole told a conference in LA that her husband Gary Clark Jr. wasn't comfortable with her breastfeeding in public.
'In Australia we breastfeed anywhere and everywhere, we are very open about it and there is no judgment. It is a very free country,' Nicole said at the Mammas Making It event, according to The Daily Telegraph.
'I'm married to a Texan and it is a very different world. Even my husband would get very uncomfortable with me breastfeeding in public. For me it was very challenging.'
The comments come two years after Nicole garnered attention for the June 2015 cover of Elle Australia, which saw her breastfeeding son Zion, now two.
'In Australia we breastfeed anywhere and everywhere, we are very open about it and there is no judgment. It is a very free country,' Nicole said at the Mammas Making It event, according to The Daily Telegraph
After the magazine hit newsstands, Nicole took to Instagram to explain the message behind the shoot was to reduce any stigma about women breastfeeding in public.
'There is nothing more powerful and beautiful than motherhood,' she began.
'The last thing I want to do is be controversial, so please take this for what it is, let us normalise breastfeeding. There is nothing worse than a mother that is judged for feeding her hungry child in public.'
Changing attitudes: Nicole told The Sunday Telegraph's Stellar magazine in December last year that husband Gary changed his views on breastfeeding after the photo shoot
She continued: 'I'm so proud of this cover and for what it stands for. I obviously don't look like this while I am breastfeeding but this stands for all women out there, whether you breastfeed or not, we gave birth, we are women, we are mothers.
'Thank you to ELLE for being so bold and making such an encouraging, positive and healthy statement.'
Nicole also told The Sunday Telegraph's Stellar magazine in December last year that husband Gary changed his views on breastfeeding after the photo shoot.

"(CNN) Russia's Foreign Ministry has indicated that it intends to keep Crimea and not return it to Ukraine because it considers it to be part of Russia.
Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters Wednesday during a weekly news conference: ""We're not returning our territory. Crimea is part of the Russian Federation.""
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Trump had been taking a tough line with Russia and that he expected Moscow to withdraw from the region, which it occupied following a "" full-scale invasion "" in 2014.
Spicer pointed to UN Ambassador Nikki Haley's recent remarks on Russia's actions in east Ukraine and occupation of Crimea, adding that Trump ""expects the Russian government to de-escalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea.""
The Ministry's declaration comes as it emerged that high-level advisers close to then-presidential nominee Donald Trump were in constant communication during the campaign with Russians known to US intelligence, multiple current and former intelligence, law enforcement and administration officials tell CNN.
Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn was forced to step down Monday after it emerged that he had discussed policy with the Russian ambassador to the US prior to his appointment. He subsequently admitted he had ""inadvertently briefed the Vice President-elect and others with incomplete information.""

Russia's statement also came as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov prepares to meet his American counterpart , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, on the sidelines of the G20 meetings in Germany this Thursday.
The Bonn summit will be Tillerson's inaugural international trip as the United States' top diplomat. He'll be joined in Bonn by Lavrov, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and representatives from the world's other major economies.
President Trump had previously buoyed the Kremlin's claim on Crimea. In July, on the campaign trail Trump had said that the Ukraine crisis was "" more of a Europe problem ,"" and that the United States should only step in on Crimea if European countries ask for help. He has also criticized NATO -- traditionally the West's bulwark against Russian aggression -- for being outdated.
In July, Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin won't make a military move into Ukraine -- even though Putin already has done just that by seizing the peninsula.
""He's not going into Ukraine, OK, just so you understand. He's not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down. You can take it anywhere you want,"" Trump said in a July interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on ""This Week.""
In the weeks before and after his inauguration, Trump's refusal to condemn Russian hacking during the election and his attacks on the intelligence community for investigating those hacks raised questions about his ties to Moscow.

Since assuming office the Trump administration has taken a much harder line on the occupation of the western part of Ukraine, a member of NATO.
Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, offered a strong condemnation of Russia in her first appearance at the UN Security Council on February 2. She called on Moscow to de-escalate violence in eastern Ukraine and said US sanctions against Moscow would remain in place until it withdraws from Crimea.
""The United States continues to condemn and call for an immediate end to the Russian occupation of Crimea,"" Haley said.

Ukrainian officials and Western leaders have reiterated their commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity, calling for the restoration of Ukraine's sovereignty over Crimea. The ongoing tensions have led to increased military presence in the region, with NATO expressing concerns over Russia's actions.

In response, Ukraine has ramped up its diplomatic efforts, seeking support from allies to counter Russia's claims. The situation remains a focal point of geopolitical strife, with both sides entrenched in their positions, making any potential resolution increasingly complex.",0.7496644258499146,1,1
"RANGERS suffered their second home defeat of the campaign to Hibernian as Neil Lennon’s side won 2-1 at Ibrox.
The Capital club were 3-2 winners in Glasgow earlier this term and goals from John McGinn and Jamie MacLaren earned them all three points on this occasion.
Rangers had pulled themselves level through Sean Goss but it was to prove another disappointing afternoon for boss Murty as he suffered another costly defeat on home soil.
After seeing his side beat Fraserburgh in the Scottish Cup in midweek, Murty reverted to the line-up that had seen off Aberdeen and Ross County on Premiership duty following their return to action last month.
It saw in-demand Alfredo Morelos lead the Light Blues’ attack once again but it was the players either side of him that had the first two openings of the game.
Jamie Murphy had a half chance to give the Gers the lead inside the opening 30 seconds, while Daniel Candeias saw an effort from the edge of the area blocked after four minutes.
It was a frantic start to what turned into an end-to-end first half as Hibernian once again went on the offensive at Ibrox and showed their own creative talents.
Wes Foderingham made a good stop from MacLaren, on to replace Brandon Barker, but was then left helpless as Florian Kamberi converted at the back post. Thankfully for Rangers, the offside flag saved them.
It was a reprieve the Gers couldn’t make the most of, however, as Josh Windass spurned a glorious chance when he fired a shot at Ofir Marciano when he only had the Hibs keeper to beat. On the follow up, Murphy couldn’t beat the Israeli either.
Hibs were causing Murty’s side plenty of problems but the opening goal continued to elude them as Foderingham held an Efe Ambrose header and a low drive from Kamberi.
Once again, Rangers recovered to create a chance of their own. Windass picked out Candeias with a neat ball over the top but Morelos couldn’t finish off the move as his weak shot was blocked by Ryan Porteous.
The first half didn’t end goalless, though. Just four minutes before the whistle, the deadlock was broken and Hibs had a reason to celebrate.
McGinn nicked the ball off Candeias in the middle of the park, strode forward and found the bottom corner of the net with a strike that left Foderingham flailing.
The smattering of boos that greeted Murty’s side at the whistle were followed by a rousing cheer as Ibrox welcomed Paul Gascoigne back once again.
The Gers legend received a warm round of applause from the home crowd but it was a goal that they really wanted to cheer as the action resumed.
Marciano made another impressive stop to deny Candeias as he got his head on Murphy’s cross, while a Windass effort was tame following a good run from Declan John.
The Welshman had the next attempt as a drive from 20y whistled by the left hand post. Minutes later, Goss’ free-kick was just wide of target as Rangers continued to push.
Murty’s side finally had the ball in the net after 64 minutes but their celebrations were short lived. James Tavernier swung in a free-kick from the left and Morelos nodded home from a couple of yards but his goal was ruled out by the linesman on the Main Stand side.
It was soon time for Murty to turn to his bench in search of a spark. Greg Docherty made his Ibrox bow as he replaced Candeias, while Cummings took over from Jason Holt.
The stage was set for a storming finish. And Goss brought Ibrox to life as he pulled Rangers level with a stunning free-kick. Marciano got a hand to it, but he couldn’t keep it out as the ball was curled into the top corner.
Just seconds later, the Light Blues fans were silenced, though, and Rangers had it all to do all over again.
Tavernier fouled Scott Allan and referee Willie Collum pointed to the spot. MacLaren stepped up and his strike was too powerful for Foderingham as Lennon’s side took the lead for the second time.
The closing stages were virtually one-way traffic as Rangers looked to salvage a point but their pressure and a series of half chances came to nothing.
Once again, it was an opportunity missed for Murty and his players as they fell six points adrift of Aberdeen in the Premiership standings.",1.0071110725402832,0,1
"...and they managed to replicate that success with a solid performance. Hibernian took the lead in the first half when Kevin Nisbet found the back of the net with a well-placed shot from inside the box. Rangers struggled to find their rhythm, and despite several attempts, they were unable to break through Hibernian's organized defense.

The second half saw Rangers push for an equalizer, and they were rewarded when Alfredo Morelos scored from close range, igniting hopes of a comeback. However, Hibernian responded quickly, with Martin Boyle restoring their lead just minutes later, capitalizing on a defensive error.

Rangers pressed hard in the closing stages, but Hibernian's goalkeeper made crucial saves to deny them any further goals. The defeat leaves Rangers with questions to answer as they look to regain their form in the league, while Hibernian celebrates a vital away victory that boosts their confidence in the campaign.",0.8027558922767639,1,1
"Warren Gatland has stressed that the British and Irish Lions tour “isn’t about Sam Warburton” after confirming that places in his Test back-row to face the All Blacks are still up for grabs ahead of this Saturday’s clash with the Maori All Blacks.
In what will be the biggest challenge for his touring side before the face New Zealand next Saturday, the Lions will take to the field at the International Stadium in Rotorua against a reinforced Maori side that boasts two All Blacks members and three recently capped internationals with a very strong Lions side that looks to be close to full strength.
One of the notable names absent though is tour captain Sam Warburton, with the openside flanker named among the replacements having played 68 minutes against the Highlanders in Tuesday’s defeat. Sean O’Brien starts in his place with another chance to impress after his strong showing against the Crusaders last Saturday, while blindside flanker Peter O’Mahony will captain the side in Warburton’s absence.
Lions video diary day 14
With Warburton’s position in the Test side currently in the balance, Gatland will used the run out against the Maori All Blacks to decide which of Warburton and O’Brien deserves to start next Saturday, but confirmed that part of the reason why he stuck with the Welshman as his squad leader is he is wise enough to know if he hasn’t earned the right to start the first Test.
“One of the reasons we selected him as captain of the squad is that he is an absolute quality player but also, this tour isn't about Sam Warburton, it's about putting the squad first,” Warburton said. “If he's not involved in the first Test because of the performance on Saturday night he will fully understand that.
“But he'll get some game time and some opportunity to keep improving his match fitness because he hasn't had a lot of rugby in recent weeks.”
British and Irish Lions player ratings vs Highlanders
15 show all British and Irish Lions player ratings vs Highlanders
1/15 Jared Payne – 6 out of 10 Coped about as well as he could in the first half with the kicks that came his way and put in a big tackle to stop Waisake Naholo on the try line, but guilty of taking his eye off the ball when Sinckler made a great break. Getty Images
2/15 Jack Nowell – 5 out of 10 Targeted defensively as the Highlanders repeatedly ran down his channel but did about as well as he could. Supported Webb well but could not out-run the scrambling defence. Getty Images
3/15 Jonathan Joseph – 7 out of 10 Overcame a nervy start as Malakai Fekitoa took the fight to him, but finished the Lions’ first try beautifully and also came to the fore defensively. Knocked on the final play of the game that probably didn’t do his performance justice. Getty Images
4/15 Robbie Henshaw – 6 out of 10 Caught out as he was left to defend two men when Naholo scored. Given the run-around by Fekitoa early but did well to chase the centre and kill off an overlap early in the game. Getty Images
5/15 Tommy Seymour – 6 out of 10 Poor start as he failed to collect two simple high balls, and was also held up when he came into the field before crashing into the Landers pack. Given a bashing by Naholo, but did well to judge the flight of the ball and collect a Sopaga cross-field kick to score. Getty Images
6/15 Dan Biggar – 7 out of 10 Strong start as his kicking was positive and landed a tricky conversion beautifully after Joseph’s score. Bounced back from a heavy tackle from Li that saw him flick the ball on to Nowell smartly, and unfortunate to be replaced by Owen Farrell when he was lining up a penalty effort. Getty Images
7/15 Rhys Webb – 6 out of 10 Glimpses of his best as he brought his awareness into the game, making one very good break down the blindside before offloading to Nowell. His box kicks remain too long though, and he at times tried to force the pass. Limped from the field short of the 50-minute mark. Getty Images
8/15 Joe Marler – 6 out of 10 His presence on the field was more noticeable when he was off it as the Lions scrum struggled to cope after his departure. Strong in defence and tried to impose on scrum-half Kayne Hammington. Getty Images
9/15 Rory Best – 5 out of 10 Suffered a cut to his head 25 minutes in that needed seeing to, but returned a few minutes later. Overpowered by his opposite number and also was hit backwards in the collision a few times, though his lineout accuracy proved solid. Getty Images
10/15 Kyle Sinckler – 6 out of 10 One lung-busting surge into the opposition half went wasted when Payne knocked on the offload. Held up well in the scrum but cost his side three points with a shoulder charge on Coltman that proved costly. Getty Images
11/15 Courtney Lawes – 5 out of 10 Did well to disrupt a lineout drive that led to a Lions turnover from Warburton, but knocked himself clean out soon after when he got his head on the wrong side trying to stop Waisake Naholo as he scored. Replaced by Alun Wyn Jones in the 26th minute. Getty Images
12/15 Iain Henderson – 6 out of 10 He has a knack of trying to force offloads without looking, but his strong carrying saw him repeatedly cross the gainline. Getty Images
13/15 James Haskell – 6 out of 10 Had to do his fair share of tackling as he wasn’t given too much chance with the ball in hand. Battle with the Highlanders back-row was a close one that probably finished level. Getty Images
14/15 Sam Warburton – 7 out of 10 Did well to disrupt the opposition ball in both the ruck and maul as he twice secured turnovers, and was smart enough to take the ball from the base of the ruck to score his try. Getty Images
15/15 CJ Stander – 7 out of 10 Looked like a man who was playing in his third consecutive match as he was knocked backwards a few times and also caught in possession twice. Mighty in defence, but lacked his usual gusto going forwards. Getty Images
Another notable omission from the side is fly-half Owen Farrell, who initially joined Warburton among the replacements only to be ruled out of the game with a thigh strain. With Johnny Sexton given the nod at fly-half, the Irishman appears to have a strong chance of claiming the Test shirt, despite Farrell being the odds-on favourite to start against the All Blacks before suffering the injury.
Gatland decided against experimenting with the possibility of starting Sexton and Farrell together at 10 and 12, but he did suggest that there’s “every chance” they could play simultaneously at some point during the Test series, with the Kiwi determined to keep some of his selections a secret from the prying eyes of the All Blacks.
“There's always those discussions, but we felt Owen's had a bit of rugby at the moment,” Gatland explained. “He's on the bench and he's covering midfield options, so we could end up with the same situation as we did last week then we could have the 10/12 combination, and we could end up with him coming on at 10 as well.
“What’s important for us is that at some stage he’s going to get some game time, whether it’s at 10 and continuing that, but for us even though it’s a strong side we’ve got to make sure we’re not fully showing our hand, we’re keeping some combinations back and keep the All Blacks guessing a little about what the final squad may be.”
Sam Warburton is fighting for his place in the Lions Test team ( Getty )
In terms of the All Blacks side that was named on Thursday for their one and only warm-up against Samoa, Gatland was unmoved on Steve Hansen’s selection with the team news being unveiled as expected, with Sonny Bill Williams returning for the first time since the 2015 Rugby World Cup final and both Brodie Retallick and Jerome Kaino fit to start after recovering from head and knee injuries.
“That looks pretty close to their Test team I think,” added Gatland. “It looks their strongest side and they're trying to get a game under their belt. I don't think they'll make too many changes.”
Gatland is yet undecided on whether to travel back to Auckland to watch the match at Eden Park before returning to Rotorua in the early hours of Saturday morning, though he may be lured by the fact that his ‘other’ side, Wales, will be taking on Tonga before the All Blacks face Samoa in a double-header.",1.0519031286239624,0,1
"""...up for grabs. The Lions head coach emphasized the importance of team performance over individual accolades as he prepares for the highly anticipated series against New Zealand. Warburton, who captained the Lions during their last tour in 2017, has been a pivotal figure in the squad's history, but Gatland insists that the focus must remain on the collective effort.

'While Sam has been a fantastic leader and player for the Lions, this tour is about building a cohesive unit that can compete at the highest level,' Gatland said. 'We have a number of talented players vying for positions, and it's crucial that we select the best combination to take on the All Blacks.'

With the series just weeks away, Gatland is keen to assess the form and fitness of his back-row options, ensuring that every player understands their role in the team's strategy. The competition for places is fierce, and the coach is ready to make tough decisions.""",0.8034964799880981,1,1

– The northern mountainous province of Yen Bai aims to develop comprehensive raw material and hi-tech processing facilities to boost the development of its agro-forestry-fishery sector.According to the province’s industrial development plan to 2020, with a vision to 2025, the province will focus on the processing industry, developing trademarks and expanding markets for local products.Yen Bai is blessed with material resources for wood processing, with 430,000 hectares of forests, including nearly 300,000 hectares of production forests, producing more than 450,000 cubic metres of wood and over 25 million bamboo trees. Between 14,000 – 15,000 hectares of new forest are planted every year.Currently, there are 104 wood processing facilities, with a combined annual capacity exceeding 176,000 cubic metres, and hundreds of other wood peeling and slicing facilities, producing over 200,000 cubic metres per year.

"As Kanye West once again made headlines for insisting “I do love Donald Trump” in a reported conversation with a radio host, another of the rapper’s statements was somewhat lost in the outrage, with people close to him reportedly concerned again about the state of his mental health.
West disclosed in that same conversation that he was addicted to opioids when he went through a high-profile meltdown in the fall of 2016. His breakdown led to his Saint Pablo tour being prematurely canceled and to his hospitalization “for his own health and safety.”
Speaking on Hot 97 Monday, host Ebro Darden described his 30-minute conversation with West over the weekend, Billboard reported. Darden said West told him that he felt like “nobody really showed love for me when I was addicted to opioids and in the hospital.”
But people close to West deny he ever had an opioid addiction, according to The Blast. And those people also are concerned that West’s statements about his “addiction,” his love for Trump and other recent “erratic” behavior are “red flags” that he may be suffering another “episode.”
“We are all worried about his current mental health,” a source close to the singer told The Blast, saying alarms also were triggered by a recent outburst in his studio, in which West proclaimed that he didn’t need people with “titles” around him telling him what to do, saying he could “do it all myself.”
West allegedly wrapped up his studio rant by announcing, “Yeezy is the new Apple,” The Blast reported.
Darden said West’s remark about an addiction to prescription painkillers came up during a 30-minute chat, during which they covered a ranged of topics, including West’s controversial statements about Trump.
Back in November 2016, during a stop in San Jose on his Saint Pablo Tour, the hip-hop star drew boos and jeers from the crowd for his extended stream-of-consciousness rants, including when he proclaimed, “If I would have voted, I would have voted for Trump.”
West subsequently canceled his tour and checked into UCLA Medical Center for eight days. He and his people never disclosed the reasons for his health crisis at the time. There was the standard “exhaustion” excuse. But there also were reports that he was “profoundly depressed and paranoid.”
In documents filed in a lawsuit over the tour cancellation, Lloyd’s of London suggested that West’s breakdown was related to his use of prescription and illegal drugs.
Following his breakdown, West resurfaced in public in December 2016 in a meeting at Trump Tower with the newly elected president, who was criticized for making incendiary racist, sexist and anti-immigration comments during the campaign. At the time, West explained on Twitter that he and the Republican leader met to “discuss multicultural issues.” West added, “It is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change.”
West has recently returned to social media after a long absence. His much-noted return has included announcements about new albums from himself and others and his collaboration with Kid Cudi.
But West, the once “potently” progressive musician, also has returned to making political statements that have prompted liberals to howl in outrage and conservatives, who never paid much attention to him before, to praise him as a “brave truth-teller,” reported Atlantic writer Spencer Kornhaber.
On Saturday, West praised Candace Owens, a rising star in right-wing media who has criticized Black Lives Matters and who thinks Trump is the “savior” of Western civilization. West tweeted, “I love the way Candace Owens thinks.”
I love the way Candace Owens thinks — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) April 21, 2018
Darden said he brought up West’s Owens comment during their conversation, accusing the husband of reality TV diva Kim Karadashian of “living in a bubble in Calabasas.”
Somehow, the subject of Owens prompted West to refer to a problem with opioid painkillers and to his perceived abandonment by friends and fans during his self-described substance abuse crisis. West’s comment about his perceived abandonment comes at the 5:35 point in the clip below.
Darden told West he was lying about people not showing concern for his well-being. “I know people who personally reached out,” he said.
At that point, West complained to Darden that he felt “demonized” for “speaking out and challenging conventional thought,” going on to tell him that he “loves” Donald Trump. The Trump comments begin at the 6.51 mark.
Those close to West are reportedly outraged that he expressed support for Trump or for an alt-right pundit like Owens, saying such comments could hurt his standing in the hip-hop community, The Blast reported.
Others told The Blast they are worried that tweets and comments to Darden could signal he’s headed to another crisis. They again insist that the breakdown he had back in November 2016 had nothing to do with an addiction. He was diagnosed at the time with an “acute mental illness,” a diagnosis he reportedly used in his defense in his lawsuit with Lloyd’s of London, The Blast said.

"""...in the shuffle. West also expressed his views on the current state of the music industry, claiming that artists are being manipulated by corporate interests. He argued that the creative freedom of musicians is being stifled by record labels and streaming platforms, which prioritize profit over artistic expression.

During the conversation, West emphasized the importance of independence for artists, suggesting that they should take control of their own careers and finances. He pointed to his own experiences in the industry, highlighting the challenges he faced while trying to maintain his vision amidst external pressures.

West's comments sparked a renewed debate about the balance between commercial success and artistic integrity in the music world. Many fans and fellow artists took to social media to share their thoughts, with some praising his candidness while others questioned his motives. As the conversation around his statements continues, it remains to be seen how this will impact his relationship with both the music industry and his political affiliations.""",0.696354866027832,1,1
"Cane harvester Shea Munro says he might challenge the Fair Work Commission's decision to reject his unfair dismissal case against Wilmar.
AFTER Wilmar caught Shea Munro working on a harvester while on paid carer's leave, they demanded he provide a detailed roster from his personal business and client list, believing he was ""double dipping"".
When he refused claiming he was ""ambushed"" and handing over his business' details was an invasion of privacy, he was sacked from the mill.
On the last day of his carer's leave, to look after his partner who had just given birth to their fourth child, the Armstrong Beach resident was working for himself harvesting cane when Wilmar's regional operations manager Craig Muddle and field officer Tony Tomlinson discovered him in a field.
The father of four was asked why he was working while on paid carer's leave.
Believing that Mr Munro was earning money while on carer's leave, he was asked to provide information about his company.
After he refused he was sacked from his $100,000 a year job at Plane Creek Mill.
The circumstances that led to his sacking were heard at the Fair Work Commission, after Mr Munro took the miller to the commission for unfair dismissal.
Shea Munro believes he was sacked unfairly: Shea Munro believes he was sacked unfairly
""It shouldn't be the 'Fair' Work Commission, just the Work Commission,"" Mr Munro said after his claim was dismissed by Commissioner Hunt last month.
Commissioner Hunt found that he was fired for ""not following through lawful and reasonable instructions from Wilmar"" to provide those details of his business.
But Mr Munro said he wouldn't have been asked for those details if Wilmar didn't believe he was ""double dipping"" which the Commissioner said he wasn't doing.
Mr Munro argued in the commission hearing that he used his paid carer's leave to look after his partner and their children in the evening when his partner's mother was not available.
Cane harvester Shea Munro says he might challenge the Fair Work Commission's decision to reject his unfair dismissal case against Wilmar. Campbell Gellie
Wilmar submitted that Mr Munro was ""double-dipping"", being paid for both harvesting and carer's leave.
""(All) to the detriment of Wilmar, Wilmar was required to pay overtime to an employee it has asked to cover Mr Munro's shift while he was on paid carer's leave,"" the company submitted to the Commission.
So two days after Mr Munro was seen harvesting he had a meeting with Mr Muddle.
He wasn't sacked but instead told to provide his detailed harvesting roster from his contracting business to the miller within two days.
But Mr Munro contested the conditions and said it would be an invasion of privacy on his business and his clients.
This brought up concerns for Wilmar about how much harvesting work Mr Munro was doing and what effect it would have on his fatigue levels while operating milling equipment.
And after he didn't comply his job was terminated.
""I accept Wilmar had a duty of care to ensure Mr Munro was not unduly fatigued whether he was going to do his private work after a shift at Wilmar, or perform his Wilmar work after his private work,"" Commissioner Hunt's decision read.
""Mr Munro was made aware that if he didn't provide the information sought, his employment may be terminated.""
On that basis Commissioner Hunt rejected Mr Munro claims that he was fired unfairly.
A Wilmar Sugar spokesperson said the company was satisfied with the decision handed down by the Fair Work Commission.
""We employ more than 2000 Queenslanders across the business and we take our responsibility to our people seriously,"" the spokesperson said.
But speaking to the Mercury, Mr Munro said the decision ""sucked"" because Wilmar was already aware of how much harvesting work he was doing.
He said the milling company planned when, where and how much cane to harvest each day his business was working.
""We were completely in the right, we sought legal advice on it,"" he said.
""Originally, the mill tried to dismiss me because they thought I was fraudulently claiming carer's leave.
""It was proved that it was well within my right under the circumstances to take that carer's leave.
""And so they moved the goal posts, so to speak, and tried to get me on something else.""
He said that was by forcing him to provide them with business details that he would never hand over.
""It was devastating financially. I was on $100,000 a year, that's a big loss, especially when you are starting out in business,"" he said.
""This business was set-up to run at a loss at the beginning and we have basically just suffered a big hit and had to cope with it.""

""I was just trying to make ends meet,"" he said. ""I didn't think it was a big deal to work for another company when I wasn't on the clock for Wilmar.""

The Fair Work Commission ruled that Munro's actions constituted a breach of his employment contract, leading to his dismissal. However, Munro argues that the decision was unfair, citing a lack of clear communication from Wilmar regarding their policies on secondary employment.

Supporters of Munro have rallied behind him, arguing that workers should have the right to seek additional income without fear of retribution.

"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Browns coach Hue Jackson doesn't like the fact that his star receiver Josh Gordon got into it on social media with Packers cornerback Damarious Randall a day after the 27-21 overtime loss to the Packers.
""I would hope that we wouldn't [do that],'' Jackson said. ""I want us to do our talking on the field with our play. That's where the focus needs to be. because that's what it's going to take to get us to winning.
""Talking isn't going to do anything. I'm sure the emotions are high. We were close to having an opportunity. We didn't finish. He didn't really make a huge catch in the second half, so I think all of that stuff fuels into it, but I would advise our players let's not get caught up in social media and going bantering back and forth. Let's just continue to play and become as good as we can over these next three weeks.""
After the game, Randall told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel ""he had one catch, any more questions?''
Gordon, who caught three passes in the first half for 69 yards and then none in the second half, took exception to the slam and responded on Twitter.
Great Win for them but let's be serious.. Considering several of our disadvantages as a team, this kid couldn't hold my jock strap on my worst day lol..@RandallTime https://t.co/ennvwjTMUH -- Flash Gordon (@JOSH_GORDONXII) December 11, 2017
To which Randall responded:
[?] [?] You must be on that s--- again https://t.co/l0MGVDqMri -- Damarious Randall (@RandallTime) December 11, 2017
Gordon's first two catches, a 38-yarder on the Browns' opening play and an 18-yard TD to cap the drive, came against zone coverage out of the slot. He caught one pass in man coverage against Randall, a 13-yard slant that led to a Duke Johnson TD catch in the second quarter.
Gordon had no catches the rest of the game, but was interfered with once at the goal-line by safety Josh Jones at the end of the half and didn't get the call. On the third play of the third quarter, Randall locked his arm and he dropped the ball with the other hand.
Randall also jammed him at the line of scrimmage on the third-and-2 in overtime and then bear-hugged him. Kizer, who reversed field and rolled left, looked to his No. 2 option over the middle in Rashard Higgins, and when he tried to wave him further downfield for a possible TD catch, Clay Matthews hit Kizer's arm and the ball popped into the air. Green Bay's Josh Jones came down with it, and the Packers went on to throw the game-winning TD pass.
Jackson refused to say that Gordon was held on the play. But he did say Gordon was interfered with at the goal-line at the end of the half by Jones.
""It's very clear to me watching the tape that we wish that the call should have been different,'' he said. ""He definitely on the video tape we saw hit the offensive player before the ball got there.""
He said the Packers didn't make adjustments to shut Gordon down in the second half. But they did roll Jones over to help Randall when they were in man.
""We attempted to throw and we called Josh's number several times,'' said Jackson. ""Sometimes the ball went someplace else. Sometimes they made a play. You saw the first third down of the second half, we tried to throw him the ball and the guy kind of had his arm locked. We couldn't get him there.
""There was the play at the end of the game. There were several other plays in between. The one where he got undercut down the left side, that ball was going to be for Josh. I don't think that they took him away. I don't think we executed at a high level as well as we did earlier.""
Jackson also attributed some of Gordon's second-half drought to Kizer not looking his way enough. There were several times Gordon was singled up on Randall where Kizer could've take the chance.
""There were a couple of times DeShone had opportunities to throw him the ball that we didn't,'' said Jackson. ""Those are the things that DeShone has to maximize his opportunities on throwing the ball to Josh. We have to continue to grow that way.""
Jackson said he had no problem with Gordon and then Corey Coleman wearing shades on the sidelines after their TDs.
""Honestly, football is supposed to be fun. I know it is fun when you are winning games and we all want more touchdowns and more celebrations, but I didn't [have an issue with it]. Obviously, I caught wind of it later than what it was. I'm sure it comes off of the [turnover chain] thing that the University of Miami did. Hey look, if that means those guys are going to keep scoring touchdowns, I will buy them some Ray-Ban glasses.""

Gordon, who has faced his share of off-field issues in the past, defended his actions, stating that he was merely responding to Randall's comments. 'I felt like I had to stand up for myself,' Gordon explained. 'But I understand the importance of staying focused on the season.'

"This morning in New York City, the streaming giant Spotify -- which began publicly trading earlier this month and has a current valuation of $28 billion -- held a press conference to announce changes to the free version of its mobile app for both iOS and Android. The company hopes that these new features, which will be rolled out in the weeks ahead, will create a sizable increase in its user numbers globally.
The company says that these changes to music fans' experience on its mobile, ad-supported app — which include 15 personalized ""music discovery"" playlists in which listeners can hear full songs on-demand as well as an optional ""data saver"" function, which reduces the amount of mobile data the app uses by up to 75 percent — will entice even more users to its free tier. Spotify's in-house playlists, such as Rap Caviar and Viva Latino, are important drivers of exposure (and by extension, revenue) for record labels and artists.
Some 90 million people currently use the free tier worldwide, while 71 million pay for its subscription service. As NPR has previously reported, 90 percent of the company's revenues come from subscriptions, not free listening.
Spotify argues that a large uptick in free-tier users could result in big gains for content creators and rights holders — mostly in terms of potential exposure to new fans. Even so, referring to the recorded music industry's glory days of peak sales, Gustav Söderström, Spotify's chief research and development officer, promised, ""This will make the 1990s look like a practice run.""
Overall, streaming is continuing to grow quickly: according to the 2017 International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) report, which was issued today, streaming revenue grew 41 percent last year, while download revenues declined by 20.5 percent and physical revenues went down 5 percent.
During Spotify's investor-day presentation last month, Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek stated that his company was working on launching its platform in some of the world's most populous markets, including India, China and across Africa. The reduced data load that Spotify promised today has the potential to make its streaming services far more friendly to users in those countries.
With these moves, Spotify is continuing to employ the classic tech-company strategy of scale-before-profit in the hopes of holding onto its first place in the music streaming marketplace, while Apple Music has amassed its 38 million subscribers to its service in just less than three years.
During a Q&A session with journalists that followed the presentation, Spotify executives were asked whether or not, with these changes to its mobile offerings and its emphasis on its free, ad-supported tier worldwide, the company would readdress or increase its payments to artists and labels. The answer was no.
Spotify is positioning its free service as a competitor to terrestrial radio worldwide, not to mention more direct competitors such as Apple Music, and that Spotify pays more to artists and rights holders than terrestrial commercial radio does. Söderström noted that radio was once the main vehicle for artist promotion, and that music fans then turned to record stores to buy music. Spotify's global head of creator services, Troy Carter (who formerly managed Lady Gaga and continues to manage Meghan Trainor, Kamasi Washington and Charlie Puth through his company Atom Factory), said that unlike the one-time profit that comes with selling a physical disc or vinyl album, streaming provides an ongoing source of revenue for artists. But, he acknowledged that with its much lower payout rates, streaming is a ""paradigm shift"" for artists. ""We're focusing on scale,"" Carter added. ""The bigger we get, the more we pay out.""",1.0123558044433594,0,1
"""...conference to discuss its future plans and innovations in the music industry. CEO Daniel Ek highlighted the company's commitment to expanding its podcast offerings, stating that Spotify aims to become the leading platform for audio content. 'We believe that audio is the future of entertainment, and we are investing heavily in exclusive content to attract and retain users,' Ek said.

During the event, Spotify announced partnerships with several high-profile creators, including a multi-year deal with a popular comedian and a new series featuring renowned musicians discussing their creative processes. The company also revealed plans to enhance its algorithm for personalized playlists, promising users an even more tailored listening experience.

As competition in the streaming market intensifies, Spotify's focus on innovation and exclusive content could be key to maintaining its edge. Analysts are watching closely to see how these strategies will impact user growth and overall revenue in the coming quarters.""",0.6756066679954529,1,1

"Worries about the impact of a tightening job market on the prospects for inflation and a surge in bond yields sent investors fleeing equities on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrials Average swooning almost 666 points, for its biggest daily percentage loss in 20 months.
It was the biggest daily point fall in the Dow since December 2008 during the financial crisis.
With Friday`s rout, Wall Street`s three major indexes logged their biggest weekly losses in two years, after closing at record highs the previous week. The S&P 500 and Dow saw their worst weeks since early January 2016 while Nasdaq had its worst week since early Feb 2016.
""People are starting to really get increasingly uncomfortable with the rapid rise in interest rates that we have seen and the uncertainty of how that is actually going to start to play out relative to competition for stocks,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
Overnight stock price losses accelerated after the U.S. Labor Department reported employment grew more than expected in January with the biggest wage gain in more than 8-1/2 years. The picture of workers commanding higher salaries fuelled expectations that inflation is on the rise, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to take a more aggressive approach to rate hikes this year.
That caused the 10-year Treasury yield to surge to 2.8450 percent the highest since Jan. 2014, which could make returns on Treasuries look more attractive relative to stocks.
But market players are not convinced that the bull market in stocks that saw the S&P 500 rise 5.6 percent in January is over. In fact many say a pull back was overdue.
""You have a jobs report today that was pretty robust all kind of feeding into the higher interest rates, greater inflation story, and I think the markets are trying to grapple with that right now,"" said Carlson.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 665.75 points, or 2.54 percent, to 25,520.96, the S&P 500 lost 59.85 points, or 2.12 percent, to 2,762.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 144.92 points, or 1.96 percent, to 7,240.95.
S&P 500 e-mini stock futures extended losses after 4 p.m. ET close in the cash market. S&P 500 futures closed down 2.3 percent, the biggest daily percentage drop since September 2016.
All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 closed down. Technology weighed the heaviest, with Microsoft pulling the sector down 3.0 percent.
The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility for the S&P 500 Index rose more than four points to 17.86, its highest since November 2016. VIX options trading volume hit a record high.
Analysts now see fourth-quarter earnings growth of 13.6 percent for the S&P 500, up from 12 percent on January 1. Half of the index`s companies have reported, 78 percent of which beat Street expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp shares were down 5.1 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively, after the oil companies posted lower-than-expected fourth-quarter profit.
Alphabet fell 5.3 percent after the Google parent`s fourth-quarter profit came in below consensus on increased spending.
Apple shares were off by 4.3 percent as investors worried about the iPhone maker`s weak outlook amid reports of scaled back iPhone X production.
Amazon.com was a bright spot, up 2.9 percent as Wall Street analysts quickly upped their price targets following the online retailer`s impressive earnings report.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 7.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.90-to-1 ratio favoured decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and 18 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 48 new highs and 103 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.39 billion shares, compared to the 7.33 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.",0.973929226398468,0,1
"...Industrial Average dropping more than 300 points by the end of the trading day. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also experienced significant declines, reflecting a broader sell-off across major sectors. Analysts noted that the recent rise in bond yields, driven by expectations of higher interest rates, has raised concerns about borrowing costs and consumer spending.

Tech stocks were particularly hard hit, with major companies like Apple and Microsoft seeing sharp declines as investors reassessed their growth outlooks in a potentially slowing economy. Financial stocks, however, showed some resilience, benefiting from the higher yield environment.

Market sentiment was further dampened by mixed economic data, which suggested that while job growth remains strong, wage increases are not keeping pace with inflation. This has led to fears that the Federal Reserve may need to take more aggressive action to curb rising prices, potentially stifling economic growth in the process.",0.6968162059783936,1,1
"After a decades-long search, two Texas brothers were reunited with their biological mother — something they once thought impossible because they belived she was dead.
Brothers Anthony Wiggs, 46, and Ray Abreu, 47, reunited with their mother after more than four long decades on August 4 at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in Texas, surrounded by teary-eyed spectators who learned of their story.
The brothers were born in Puerto Rico but were separated from each other and their mother when their parent’s marriage fell apart in the 1970s and Wiggs was adopted by a loving family in the U.S. Amazingly enough, the brothers would reunite almost 30 years later in Texas after Wiggs used his own detective work to discover his brother lived in San Antonio, where he had been taken by their father as a child.
Wiggs would continue his search for their mother, even though their father and others had told them she had died long ago.
“I continued my search because I wanted to see my own features in someone else,” Wiggs, 46, tells PEOPLE. “I didn’t know whether she was alive or whether she was dead—was she killed, did she kill herself? We didn’t know.”
In May, Wiggs used a DNA test through Ancestry.com that led him his mother’s nephew, who told him that his mother, Elsie Ramirez, 64, was alive and living in Massachusetts.
Wiggs tracked down his mother’s best friend on Facebook and was given her phone number. That same day, the brothers would be on a three-way call with their mother, their first contact with her since they were babies. The family decided to fly Ramirez to Texas on Aug. 4, and as Abreu says, the days leading up to the in-person reunion were taxing.
“There were times I couldn’t sleep,” he says. “I was tossing and turning and watching the hour glass get closer and closer to when I was finally going to see her.”
For the two brothers, their mother and the reunion was everything they had hoped.
“I was biting my lip and sweating along my eyebrows,” Abreu says. “That first embrace — my heart was racing as I was hugging her.”
For Wiggs, it was a culmination of a decade’s long journey that was powered by his instincts and determination.
“It feels surreal, it just one of those things that I’ve been thinking about for so long,” Wiggs says of the meeting. “After looking for all those years, it took time, it took energy, and it took so many emotions, but I can say, ‘I did it.’ ”
The brothers say they have been surprised by how much they have in common with Ramirez. She loves Bob Marley, just like they do, and she fits in perfectly with their sarcasm and humor. Most of all, though, they look forward to the mornings and nights that they will be able to say “I love you” to their mother, for many years to come.
“When she wasn’t in my life, I used to pray that if Mom was up there in Heaven looking down on me, that she was my guardian angel and one day I would see her,” Abreu says. “Now, I don’t have to say those prayers anymore.”",1.0174472332000732,0,1
"...Michael Wiggs, 44, had been raised in foster care after being separated from their mother at a young age. For years, they searched for answers about their origins, often facing dead ends and heartbreak. Their journey took a surprising turn when they discovered a social media group dedicated to helping people find their biological families. 

With the help of DNA testing, the brothers were able to trace their lineage and eventually connect with their mother, who had been living in a different state. The emotional reunion took place in a park, where they embraced for the first time, tears of joy streaming down their faces. 

Their mother, who had been searching for them as well, expressed her relief and happiness at finally being together. The brothers now look forward to rebuilding their relationship and learning more about the family they thought they had lost forever.",0.6681537628173828,1,1
"The latest episode of the Canadian Couch Potato podcast focuses on the relationship between cost and complexity in your investment plan.
You can often lower fees in your portfolio with a few simple changes that require no additional skill or effort. But there are times when accepting slightly higher costs in exchange for simplicity and convenience is actually a wiser choice. There's no single solution: every investor needs to find their sweet spot along that continuum.
My guest on this episode is John Robertson, author of The Value of Simple, which has just been published in a revised second edition. John's book does an excellent job of stressing these ideas. In the book-and in our interview-he discusses the various options available for investors looking to get started with indexing. These include the three options in my model portfolios, as well as a discussion of how robo-advisors fit into the landscape.
For those interested in comparing robo-advisors, John co-created a tool called AutoInvest.ca, which allows you to compare the all-in costs of the various options. This is not as straightforward as it might seem, as robo-advisors use different pricing models. I suggest clicking the ""Advanced Filters"" tab on the calculator to take full advantage of the tool. (You should also be aware that the site receives affiliate commissions.)
John has also adapted this material into an online course called Practical Index Investing for Canadians. It expands on the ideas in the book and includes step-by-step tutorial videos showing you how to open new accounts and build your portfolio at Tangerine, TD Direct Investing and Questrade.
Switching to Vanguard's one-fund portfolios
In the Ask the Spud segment of the podcast, I take a detailed look at Vanguard's newly launched asset allocation ETFs. These funds, which I introduced in an earlier blog post, have led some investors to suggest they have made all other options more or less obsolete.
Certainly these one-fund portfolios with a management fee of just 0.22% are among the most useful ETFs to come along in the last few years. But if you're successfully using an option such as Tangerine or TD's e-Series funds, make sure you understand the trade-offs. Using ETFs will always result in lower management fees, but these are not the only factor. Consider the following:
The size of your portfolio. Any time you compare annual fees, be sure to understand the differences in dollar terms, not just percentages. Lowering your fees from 1% to 0.25%, for example, makes a much bigger impact on a $100,000 portfolio than it does for someone who is still in the early stages of building wealth.
Here's a rule of thumb you can use when considering whether to dump your index mutual funds in favour of the Vanguard ETFs: switching from the TD e-Series funds to one of the new ETFs will save you less than $2 a month for every $10,000 you have invested. Switching from Tangerine will save you closer to $7 a month.
Whether you make regular contributions. One of the best ways to build wealth is to save a little every month and to have those contributions invested automatically. Index mutual funds and robo-advisors allow you to set up plans that automate this process, which has value for those who prefer being hands-off. You can't do this with ETFs, so your savings plan will not only involve more work, but also more potential to fall into behavioural traps. (""Should I really invest this month with all of the volatility in the market?"")
Your experience trading ETFs. Learning to invest with an online brokerage isn't terribly difficult, but it can be intimating and confusing if you have no experience placing orders on an exchange. Do you know the difference between a bid price and an ask price? Between a market order and a limit order? If not, take the time to learn before you bail on your user-friendly index mutual funds.
The number and types of accounts in your portfolio. If you're investing only in a TFSA or RRSP, or even both, then the new Vanguard ETFs are an excellent choice. But if you have a more complicated portfolio that includes multiple accounts for yourself and a spouse, then a one-fund solution is probably not ideal. More complex situations require more flexibility than a balanced ETF can offer. This is especially true if a significant amount of the portfolio is taxable, since the Vanguard asset allocation ETFs are not particularly attractive in non-registered accounts.
Your target asset mix. The new Vanguard ETFs are best suited to investors who want to hold either 60% or 80% equities: those are the targets for the Balanced (VBAL) and Growth (VGRO) versions. If your target allocation is 50% or 70% stocks, there isn't an ETF with either of those asset mixes. And the Conservative version, VCNS, with 60% bonds, including a lot of U.S. and global fixed income, is not as attractive as the other two ETFs. If you're a conservative investor, I'd suggest adding some GICs to your portfolio instead of holding 60% bonds.",0.9839080572128296,0,1
"...a more straightforward investment strategy. By opting for low-cost index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investors can reduce management fees while still achieving broad market exposure. The podcast emphasizes that a simpler portfolio not only saves money but also makes it easier to manage and understand.

Listeners are encouraged to evaluate their current investments and consider whether they are paying for active management that may not outperform the market. The hosts discuss the importance of aligning investment choices with personal financial goals and risk tolerance, suggesting that complexity often leads to confusion and emotional decision-making.

Additionally, the episode features interviews with financial experts who share insights on how to build a cost-effective portfolio without sacrificing performance. They highlight the significance of regular portfolio reviews and rebalancing to maintain an optimal asset allocation, ensuring that investors stay on track toward their long-term objectives.",0.7200538516044617,1,1

FORT PIERCE, Fla. -- The cafeteria at Lincoln Park Academy in Fort Pierce is busy, but not for long. This is the last week of school.
For thousands of students in the Saint Lucie County, school is the only place they know they're going to eat a full meal -- thanks to the district's meal program.
Deborah Weust is the Director of Child Nutrition Services: ""We do about for the whole year we do about 4.3 million meals.""
The Saint Lucie County School District says it doesn't want kids to go hungry, so the program will continue through the summer.
""The great thing about the summer program is that we offer breakfast and lunch at about 18 sites this summer,"" according to Weust.
And this summer she says there's something new.
""We have a mobile bus which we call the bright bite bus. We took a regular school bus and we gutted it all out and added chairs and tables so that students can get a meal,"" Weust said.
Jennifer Muzzin is the Farm To School Specialist. She says it's about keeping kids well fed and eating healthy, even when there is no school in session.

"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Emboldened and proclaiming victory after a bloody weekend in Virginia, white nationalists are planning more demonstrations to promote their agenda following the violence that left a woman dead and dozens injured.
The University of Florida said white provocateur Richard Spencer, whose appearances sometimes stoke unrest, is seeking permission to speak there next month. And white nationalist Preston Wiginton said he is planning a “White Lives Matter” rally at Texas A&M University in September.
Also, a neo-Confederate group has asked the state of Virginia for permission to rally at a monument to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Richmond on Sept. 16, and other events are likely.
“We’re going to be more active than ever before,” Matthew Heimbach, a white nationalist leader, said Monday.
James Alex Fields Jr., a young man who was said to idolize Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany in high school, was charged with killing a woman by slamming a car into a group of counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally Sunday in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Fields, 20, who recently moved to Ohio from his home state of Kentucky, was held without bail on murder charges. He was photographed at the rally behind a shield bearing the emblem of the white nationalist Vanguard America, though the group denied he was a member.
Two state troopers also died Sunday when their helicopter crashed during an effort to contain the violence.
The U.S. Justice Department said it will review the violence, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions told ABC that the death of counter-protester Heather Heyer, 32, met the definition of domestic terrorism.
White nationalists said they were undaunted.
Heimbach, who said he was pepper-sprayed during the melee in Charlottesville, called the event Saturday “an absolute stunning victory” for the far right because of the large number of supporters who descended on the city to decry plans to remove a statue of Lee.
Hundreds of white nationalists, white supremacists, neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and others were involved, by some estimates, in what Heimbach, leader of the Traditionalist Workers Party, called the nation’s biggest such event in a decade or more. Even more opponents turned out, and the two sides clashed violently.
A neo-Nazi website that helped promote the gathering said there will be more events soon.
“We are going to start doing this nonstop. Across the country,” said the site, which internet domain host GoDaddy said it was shutting down after it mocked the woman killed in Charlottesville.
The head of the National Socialist Movement, Jeff Schoep, said Charlottesville was a “really good” white nationalist event that was being overshadowed by the deaths. “Any time someone loses their life it’s unfortunate,” he said.
He blamed the violence on inadequate police protection and counter-demonstrators and said he doubts white nationalists will be deterred from attending more such demonstrations.
Preserving memorials to the Old South has become an animating force for the white nationalist movement, not because all members are Southern, Schoep said, but because adherents see the drive to remove such monuments as part of a larger, anti-white crusade.
“It’s an assault on American freedoms. Today it’s Confederate monuments. Tomorrow it may be the Constitution or the American flag,” Schoep said.
At the University of Florida, where Spencer has asked to speak, President W. Kent Fuchs called the events in Virginia “deplorable” but indicated school officials might be unable to block his appearance.
“While this speaker’s views do not align with our values as an institution, we must follow the law, upholding the First Amendment not to discriminate based on content and provide access to a public space,” Fuchs said in a message on the university’s Facebook page.

Local authorities are bracing for potential unrest, with many cities considering increased security measures to prevent violence. Activist groups are also mobilizing, planning counter-protests to challenge the ideologies of the white nationalists. The events have reignited a national conversation about race, hate speech, and the legacy of Confederate symbols in America. As tensions rise, community leaders are urging dialogue and understanding, while others call for stricter regulations on hate groups.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump’s longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen, on Wednesday accused adult film actress Stormy Daniels’ lawyer of leaking Cohen’s bank records to the press, calling it a “drive-by shooting of my client’s rights.”

The comments by Cohen lawyer Stephen Ryan regarding Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti, came during an often-heated hearing before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan related to a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors into Cohen’s business dealings.
Avenatti told Wood he did not release anything improper about Cohen, who has not been charged with a crime.
But the judge told Avenatti he would not have free rein in her courtroom “to denigrate Mr. Cohen and, I believe, potentially, deprive him of a fair trial by tainting a jury pool” should criminal charges be brought against Cohen.
Leaks could make it harder for Cohen to get a fair trial if he were charged. Legal experts have said he might choose to cooperate with prosecutors as pressure mounts.
The investigation stems in part from a referral by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is probing whether Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia.

Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion, and Russia has denied meddling in the U.S. election.
At Wednesday’s hearing, Wood set a June 15 deadline for Cohen’s and Trump’s lawyers to identify materials seized in April raids on his home, office and hotel room, which they say prosecutors cannot use by prosecutors because the materials are subject to attorney-client privilege.
Wood said a “taint team” of prosecutors not involved in the Cohen probe would make the determinations after that date.
Ryan, one of Cohen’s lawyers, said in court that Avenatti acted maliciously by releasing his client’s bank records and attacking Cohen in dozens of media appearances, to “paint a false narrative” about Cohen and “call attention to himself.”

Avenatti has released details of payments to Cohen from a company linked to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who the United States sanctioned over suspected meddling in the election.
Avenatti’s involvement has complicated the Cohen probe.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she had a sexual encounter with Trump, and sued Cohen in March to end an agreement under which Cohen paid her $130,000 not to discuss it. Trump has denied having sex with Daniels.
Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Avenatti signaled that more disclosures are forthcoming.
“We’ve got a whole host of information that we are going to be releasing relating to Mr. Cohen and relating to Mr. Trump, so they better buckle up,” he said.
The June 15 deadline to review documents seized from Cohen was a month sooner than Cohen’s lawyers had wanted.
Todd Harrison, a lawyer for Cohen, said his firm was “moving heaven and Earth” to review documents. He said they have reviewed about 1.3 million of the 3.7 million files turned over.
But the judge said taking too long was not an option.
“It’s important for the court to balance the slow, deliberate needs of those asserting attorney-client privilege with the need for an investigation to go forward,” Wood said.",0.960132896900177,0,1
"...to the media in an attempt to undermine Cohen's credibility. The lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, claimed that the release of the financial documents was a deliberate act to sway public opinion against Cohen as he cooperates with federal investigations.

Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, denied the allegations, asserting that the information was obtained through legal means and was in the public interest. ""We will not be intimidated by Cohen or his legal team,"" Avenatti stated during a press conference. 

The controversy centers around a $130,000 payment made to Daniels shortly before the 2016 presidential election, which Cohen has admitted to facilitating. This payment has raised questions about campaign finance violations and the extent of Trump's knowledge and involvement. As investigations continue, both sides are preparing for a legal battle that could have significant implications for the Trump administration.",0.7131263017654419,1,1
"Cubs' Kris Bryant reacts after reaching second base on an RBI double in the sixth inning on Friday. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, Associated Press)
Washington — Kyle Hendricks goes about things completely differently than Stephen Strasburg does on the mound.
The kid from Dartmouth relies on a fastball that on a good day reaches 88 mph — about 10 mph slower than Strasburg’s — and a deceptive changeup. Instead of power, he gets by on precision, guile and smarts.
Hendricks outpitched Strasburg in Game 1 of the NL Division Series, giving up only two hits in seven innings to help the Chicago Cubs open defense of their first World Series title in 108 years by beating the Washington Nationals, 3-0, on Friday night.
“That’s why we call him Professor,” Chicago second baseman Javier Baez said about Hendricks. “He knows what he’s doing.”
Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo produced RBI singles with two outs in the sixth inning for the first two hits off an otherwise-dominant Strasburg. Rizzo added a run-scoring double in the eighth off Ryan Madson.
Carl Edwards Jr. threw a perfect inning and Wade Davis finished the two-hitter for a save.
Unlike No. 1 overall draft pick Strasburg, Hendricks went in the eighth round. Unlike Strasburg, Hendricks has never been an All-Star. Unlike Strasburg, who already has signed a $175 million, seven-year deal that begins next season, Hendricks earned less than $800,000 in 2017.
But this was Hendricks’ time to shine.
“He was tricking us tonight,” Nationals manager Dusty Baker said, “and seems like those kind of guys give us more trouble than guys who throw hard.”
The slender righty, who led the NL in ERA last season, gave up a single in the first and another in the second — and that was it for the Nationals.
He walked three batters and struck out six.
“He knows the scouting report,” said Jon Lester, who starts Game 2 on Saturday for Chicago against fellow lefty Gio Gonzalez. “He knows where guys’ weaknesses are.”
Harper — wearing shoes with “Pray for Las Vegas” written on the side following the recent mass shooting in his hometown — was 1 for 4 as he tries to regain his timing after returning last week from a 42-game injury absence. Otherwise, Washington’s elite hitters — Anthony Rendon, Ryan Zimmerman, Daniel Murphy, Trea Turner and Jayson Werth — were a combined 0 for 17 with three walks.
“Definitely, your confidence builds,” Hendricks said, “when you start seeing those swings.”
The fact that Hendricks approached 90 mph as often as he did was an aberration he and teammates attributed to adrenaline, but one that helped, of course.
He also knew he needed to be really good, because of what Strasburg was doing.
Strasburg didn’t allow a hit until there were two outs in the sixth. Baez reached on Rendon’s error at third base to start the inning and was sacrificed to second by Hendricks. One out later, Bryant drove in the first run with a single to right-center and went to second when Harper’s throw missed the cutoff man.
Bryant, Rizzo said, managed to “get the monkey off the back in the dugout for all of us.”
Rizzo followed by singling to right in front of a diving Harper to make it 2-0.
With a heavy beard and a lot of sweat on a muggy, 77-degree night, Strasburg dialed up his fastball to 98 mph and mixed in an unhittable changeup. To cheers of “Let’s go, Strasburg!” from many in a sellout crowd of 43,898, he struck out 10 to set a playoff record for the Expos-Nationals franchise.
Strasburg wound up allowing just those two unearned runs in seven innings, with three hits and one walk.
“You’re aware of it,” Hendricks said about Strasburg. “You know how well he’s throwing on the other side.”
Hendricks threw well, too.
“It was,” Cubs catcher Willson Contreras said, “a masterpiece.”",0.9811896085739136,0,1
"...his business quietly, but his impact on the mound speaks volumes. The Chicago Cubs' right-hander delivered a masterful performance against the Washington Nationals, showcasing his trademark precision and poise. Hendricks allowed just two runs over seven innings, striking out six and walking none, as he kept the Nationals' lineup off balance with his mix of pitches.

The Cubs' offense supported him well, with Kris Bryant's RBI double in the sixth inning providing a crucial insurance run. Bryant's hit came at a pivotal moment, extending the Cubs' lead and energizing the dugout. ""We needed that hit to keep the momentum going,"" Hendricks said after the game. 

The Cubs' bullpen held strong in the final frames, sealing the victory and giving the team a much-needed boost in the playoff race. With this win, the Cubs continue to chase a postseason berth, and Hendricks' steady hand will be vital in the coming weeks.",0.7607192397117615,1,1

"It is clear now that Delhi Chief Minister has given up his brand of combative (AAP) supremo Kejriwal launched into an apology spree and apologised to Congress leader Kapil Sibal's son Amit Sibal and Union minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader for making unverified allegations of corruption against them. The development came days after Kejriwal apologised to former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia. After he tendered his apology, Kejriwal was acquitted in two separate defamation cases lodged against him by Amit Sibal, a senior advocate and son of former Union minister Kapil Sibal, and Gadkari. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, a co-accused with Kejriwal in the lodged by Sibal, was also acquitted after he, too, tendered an apology to the lawyer. Kejriwal intends to bring an end to the 33 defamation cases against him by means of similar out-of-court settlements and individual ""understandings"", say sources. According to AAP leaders, the various cases have drained the party's resources and money. The Congress and the BJP, however, hauled Kejriwal over the coals. The Opposition party advised that the Delhi chief minister should change his name to Arvind 'Sorry' Kejriwal, while the ruling party at the Centre lashed out at the AAP chief's brand of The AAP chief has been dragged to courts in multiple defamation cases lodged by various political leaders, including Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and former Delhi chief minister Kejriwal still has to contend with Jaitley's case, and sources in the AAP had told news agencies last week that the senior BJP leader could also soon receive an apology from the Delhi chief minister. Last week, Kejriwal wrote to Akali Dal leader Bikram Majithia, apologising for accusing him of being involved in drug trade without any proof to back the allegations. The apology, however, did not go down to well with everyone and triggered what amounted to a virtual rebellion in the AAP Punjab unit. Subsequently, Bhagwant Mann resigned as AAP's Punjab unit chief. However, things seem to have improved since Kejriwal's meeting with AAP members of the Punjab legislative Assembly, with most saying they understand the decision of the party's convenor. Amit Sibal had filed a defamation suit against Kejriwal and Sisodia for alleging that Kapil Sibal had a conflict in seeking to revise a tax demand on telecom major Vodafone. In 2014, Gadkari had filed a defamation suit against Kejriwal after the AAP chief named him in a list of ""corrupt politicians"". In the filed by Gadkari, it was alleged that Kejriwal had called him ""India's most corrupt"". Here are the top 10 developments in Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's apology spree that has so far covered Majithia, Sibal and Gadkari: 1) BJP says 'anarchic character' of Kejriwal's exposed: BJP's Delhi unit chief Manoj Tiwari took a dig at Kejriwal and his apologies, stating that the ""anarchic character"" of the ""NGO politics"" practised by the Delhi chief minister now stood exposed before the people of the country. Tiwari also alleged that Kejriwal was a regular violator of the law and that he had, in connivance with a section of the media preferring to run anti-establishment news, ""misused"" the Right to Information Act against his political opponents. 2) Shivraj Singh Chouhan has a piece of advice for the AAP chief: Kejriwal, who has received much ridicule over his apologies, given his past brand of politics, also received some advice on how to go about his apology spree. The Delhi chief minister's Madhya Pradesh counterpart, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, tweeted a piece of advice: ""Arvind-ji, if you heed my suggestion then make a list of people that you need to apologise to and prepare an apology letter headed 'To whomsoever it may concern'. ""This would save you the hassle of apologising repeatedly,"" Chouhan's tweet said. ALSO READ: Kejriwal's 'sorry' syndrome: Shivraj Singh Chouhan's advice to Delhi CM 3) Congress says AAP chief should change his name: The Congress on Monday advised the Delhi Chief Minister to change his name to Arvind 'Sorry' Kejriwal, adding that this is what happened when ""one does for sensationalism"". Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjwala said, ""There is a sorry Chief Minister in the country. He should change his name to Arvind Sorry Kejriwal. This is just the beginning of his trail of saying sorry, and not the end."" ""He also has to apologise to the people of Delhi and the country, whom he has deceived,"" added Surjwala. ""He also has to apologise for poor governance. When you do only for sensationalism, and not for balance, then this going to be the consequence,"" said the Congress leaders, adding, ""The propaganda which was spread by him and his associates in collusion with BJP-RSS at Ram Leela Maidan during UPA rule, the truth of it has come out."" ""Delhi is sorry to have Kejriwal and his government,"" he added. 4) Sisodia says don't want to waste time on defamation cases: Defending his party chief's apologies to Majithia, Gadkari, and Sibal, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister said on Monday that he would use his time in service of the people instead of doing rounds of the courts for defamation cases filed against him and Kejriwal. ""We will apologise to the people we have hurt. We're here to serve the people; we do not have the time to go to courts for such issues,"" said Sisodia, adding, ""We're here to build schools and hospitals for the welfare of people.""
ALSO READ: Kejriwal says sorry to Gadkari, Sibal, Majithia; Arun Jaitley next? updates Sources have told news agencies that Kejriwal intends to bring an end to all the defamation cases against him, which reportedly number 33, by means of similar out of court settlements and individual ""understandings"". According to AAP leaders, the various cases have drained the party's resources and money.
5) says Kejriwal backing off 'meekly': Displeased by his string of apologies, Displeased by his string of apologies, former AAP leader attacked Arvind Kejriwal , asking the AAP chief why he had published a list of 20 ""corrupt politicians"" if he wanted to ""back off meekly"". Further, Damania rejected Kejriwal's contention that he wanted to focus his strength in Delhi.
""Ideally, with a strong MLA force of 67 out of 70 MLAs, he should have entrusted the functioning of the Delhi government to his trusted MLAs and fought each one of the cases and ensured victory in every single matter and punish(ed) these corrupt politicians,"" she said. ""It is extremely upsetting to see Arvind seeking apology from Gadkari despite concrete evidences given by me. Why on the earth had the AAP issued a list of 20 most corrupt politicians if they were to back off meekly?"" added Damania.
Damania was once a key associate of Kejriwal. She had accused Gadkari of irregularities in his Purti Group of companies. Kejriwal, for his part, had gone on to name Gadkari as one of the most corrupt politicians in India. Taking objection to this, Gadkari had moved the court against Kejriwal for allegedly defaming him.
Besides spear-heading the campaign against Gadkari, Damania had also contested against him from Nagpur in the Lok Sabha polls 2014.

Damania had quit AAP in 2015 at a time when the party was witnessing an ugly spat between and Yogendra Yadav on one side and Kejriwal on the other.
6) acquitted in Gadkari and Sibal defamation cases: Despite the criticism, Despite the criticism, AAP's apology strategy does seem to be paying off , at least as far as dealing with the defamation cases is concerned, concerns over how it will impact the party's political image notwithstanding. Kejriwal was on Monday acquitted in the two separate defamation cases lodged against him by Gadkari and Amit Sibal after he issued an apology to both of them.
After also tendered an apology to Amit Sibal through a letter, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Samar Vishal acquitted the deputy Delhi chief minister, who was a co-accused along with Kejriwal in the lodged by Sibal.
The relief came from the court after the apologies were accepted by the complainants in both the cases.

Jaitley had filed the second defamation suit after Jethmalani allegedly ""abused"" him in the open court during the proceedings of the original defamation suit he had filed against the AAP chief and five other party functionaries.
However, the chief minister maintained that apart from the ground of ""absolute privilege, the present suit is also barred by Section 126 of the Indian Evidence Act"".
""The statement, upon which the suit is based on alleged defamatory imputations made by the senior advocate (without any oath), allegedly on the instructions of the defendant (Kejriwal), which he could not have disclosed,"" Kejriwal said in his written statement filed through advocate Anupam Srivastava.
Section 126 of the Evidence Act bars disclosure of any professional communication between an advocate and his client, including instructions given by the client in relation to his case.
During the cross-examination of the minister on May 17 last year before Joint Registrar in the Delhi High Court, Jethmalani had used a term Jaitley found objectionable.

Both leaders withdrew their defamation cases against the AAP chief on Monday.
In a March 16 letter to Gadkari, Kejriwal said he was feeling sorry for making ""certain statements, without regard to its verifiability, which seem to have hurt you..."".
""I have nothing personal against you. I regret the same. Let us put the incident behind us and bring the court proceedings to a closure,"" said the letter.
Addressing the Union Shipping and Transport Minister, Kejriwal also suggested that ""we should put our energy to serve the people of this country in the spirit of mutual respect"".

"As technology stocks sank on Monday, CNBC's Jim Cramer wanted to examine a name outside the line of fire: the stock of e-commerce platform Etsy.
Cramer was skeptical when Etsy first came public in 2015. But he changed his tune since the IPO, blessing the stock for speculation in May 2016 and recommending it again in August 2017.
Since last August, shares of Etsy have climbed 78 percent, and Cramer argued that the move was totally due to the company's fundamentals — a good sign for prospective investors.
""A lot of people at one point were worried that Etsy would be steamrolled by Amazon after the retail 'Death Star' launched their own marketplace for handcrafted goods. Turns out Etsy is incredibly resilient,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
""We know that because Etsy's most recent quarter was a gigantic blowout,"" he continued. ""So any chance to buy this thing into weakness is an opportunity.""
Amazon's influence has proven to be a legitimate threat for online and brick-and-mortar retailers alike. But its push into the handmade market has not been enough to crush Etsy, which helps a network of nearly two million sellers compete in the digital retail space, Cramer said.
Most companies that compete with Amazon fear the online giant's scale, but in this case, scale is on Etsy's side, the ""Mad Money"" host continued.
Etsy has tens of millions of handmade goods for sale on its website; Amazon Handmade has less than one million, he noted.
Etsy has also been improving the buyer experience with better search and recommendation functions, which translated into better holiday sales and growth across all of its core markets.
Better yet, the company's 2017 management shakeup — in which it brought in a new chief financial officer, a new chief technology officer and a new CEO — went off without a hitch, Cramer said.
""And boy, oh boy, can this new team deliver,"" he said. ""When Etsy reported its latest quarter last month, they knocked it out of the park.""
Beating earnings and revenue estimates, Etsy's fourth quarter showed better-than-expected gross merchandise sellers, growth in its mobile business and a higher conversion rate, or the percentage of consumers who end up buying something after visiting Etsy's website.
Management also gave strong full-year guidance for 2018, kick-starting a more than 30 percent run in Etsy's stock before Monday's weakness hit.
""That is an epic run, which is why I'm so glad Etsy's finally pulling back with the rest of tech, down 1.66 percent today,"" Cramer said. ""Ideally, it goes even lower and you get even better prices. I say 'ideally' because this sell-off has nothing to do with Etsy and I believe it will bounce back with alacrity once investors calm down.""
Cramer acknowledged that shares of Etsy look expensive, currently valued at 53 times next year's earnings estimates. But based on the company's 2021 estimates, its valuation is only 29 times earnings, a better deal for a growth stock, he said.
""The bottom line? This was a really ugly day for the stock market, not denying it, but you need to stay calm. Approach sell-offs like this one as buying opportunities, at least when it comes to high-quality stocks of companies with great fundamentals,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
""Etsy's stock got hit today, but its business is in amazing shape. You have my blessing to pick some up here right now, tomorrow, even more if the pain continues, which may very well be the case given the ferocity of the Nasdaq portion of the sell-off.""",0.9344799518585205,0,1
"...reported its latest earnings, noting that while the company had shown resilience during the pandemic, the post-COVID landscape posed new challenges. Cramer pointed out that Etsy's growth was heavily reliant on consumer spending, which could be affected by rising inflation and interest rates. He highlighted that the platform's unique selling proposition—handmade and vintage items—might not be enough to shield it from broader economic pressures.

Despite his concerns, Cramer acknowledged that Etsy had a loyal customer base and a strong brand identity. He suggested that investors should keep an eye on the company's ability to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions. Cramer also mentioned the importance of Etsy's efforts to enhance its seller tools and improve the overall shopping experience, which could help maintain its competitive edge. Ultimately, he advised caution, urging investors to weigh the potential risks against the company's long-term growth prospects before making any decisions.",0.7368420958518982,1,1

Ten hits and a solid outing from lefty Matt Gage were not enough for Richmond on Monday as the Squirrels (4-7) dropped game one to the Bowie Baysox (7-4), 3-2 at Prince George’s Stadium. Bowie’s Austin Wynns smacked a three-run homer in the sixth inning to produce the lead. MLB right-hander Chris Tillman pitched 2 2/3 innings in a rehab assignment and allowed a solo home run to Carlos Garcia in the first.
It didn’t take long for Richmond to attack the MLB rehabber Chris Tillman. With one out in the first inning, Carlos Garcia drilled a solo home run over the right field wall to take a 1-0 lead. Tillman bookended the homer with a pair of strikeouts and retired the next six batters he faced.
Matt Gage pitched with traffic early on, but was able to navigate trouble. The lefty allowed a walk and a hit in the first inning and two more hits in the second. He picked up a double play with two on and one out in the third to keep Richmond in front 1-0. Gage threw 54 pitches through the first three innings of work.
Tillman ran into trouble in the third inning and had his rehab appearance cut short with two outs. Rando Moreno worked a walk to begin the third and Slade Heathcott roped a single to right. Tillman then induced a fly ball to right field before reaching his pitch limit. Lucas Long replaced Tillman and stranded both inherited runners. Tillman finished with one walk and three strikeouts. He allowed the one run on two hits in the no-decision.
After walking the tightrope through the first three innings, Gage settled in and picked up the pace. The lefty retired the side in the fourth inning and cruised until he hit the batter Drew Dosch to start the sixth. Dosh moved to third base on a one-out double and Austin Wynns put Bowie ahead with a three-run homer to left center field. Gage (0-1) relinquished a double to the next batter and was replaced by Tyler Cyr. The lefty lasted 5 2/3 and allowed the three runs on seven hits. He struck out six and walked one in the loss.
Lucas Long found success in relief for Bowie and kept Richmond silent until the top of the seventh. T.J. Bennett drilled a doubleinto the left field corner and Rando Moreno delivered a two-out double up the first base line to trim the Bowie lead, 3-2. Long was able to strand Moreno at second to close out the inning. Long earned the win by scattering seven hits over 5 1/3 innings of work. He struck out three and did not walk a batter.
Richmond threatened to tie the game in the ninth when Tyler Horan roped a single to right field to open the inning. Closer Garrett Cleavinger then struck out two of the next three batters to end the game and earn the save.
Game two of the four game series is Tuesday night at 6:35 p.m. in Bowie, MD. Right right-hander Jordan Johnson is scheduled to start on Tuesday against TBD for Bowie.

"...editor, and more. The Bowie Baysox edged out the Richmond Squirrels in a nail-biting series opener on Tuesday night, securing a 4-3 victory at Prince George's Stadium. The game was marked by a late-inning rally that saw the Baysox capitalize on a critical error by the Squirrels' defense.

Bowie's starting pitcher, Jake McCarthy, delivered a solid performance, striking out seven batters over six innings. However, it was the Baysox's offense that stole the show, with a standout performance from outfielder Marcus Lee, who went 3-for-4 at the plate, including a crucial two-run double in the seventh inning.

Richmond fought back valiantly, with a home run from first baseman Tom Reed that brought the Squirrels within one run in the ninth. Despite their efforts, Bowie’s closer, Alex Torres, held firm, securing the final out and sealing the win for the Baysox. The teams will face off again tomorrow night in what promises to be another thrilling matchup.",0.8103874921798706,1,1
"Manchester United's surge up the Premier League table continued with a victory over 10-man West Ham on Monday.
Given how much happened on the field, those watching could be forgiven for missing bits and pieces around the periphery.
But don't worry, Sportsmail was on hand to make sure everything that passed you by has been preserved for posterity in one tidy little bundle. It's our pleasure...

MOURINHO vs HAMMERHEAD
After all the controversy of Harry the Hornet's dive at the feet of Wilfried Zaha, the mascots of the Premier League are under constant watch in the early days of 2017.
When West Ham's very own 'Hammerhead' - a cunning cross between a shark and a household tool - approached Jose Mourinho on his way to the United bench, therefore, all sorts of options were possible.
Would 'Hammerhead' run, arms aloft, along the touchline before powersliding like at 70s lead guitarist at the Portuguese's feet? Would he mock Mourinho with a series of put-me-downs based entirely on the latest Black & Decker range? Would he slap him round the head with a copy of the Wickes catalogue?
Sadly not. He barely flexed a muscle.
Hammerhead bottled it.

NO COACH PROBLEMS
After their last experience of visiting West Ham, United's players could have been forgiven for donning suits of armour for their return trip.
But, unlike the scenes that greeted them ahead of the final game at Upton Park in May - when the team coach was treated like a bottle bank by fans who may or may not have been to the pub - a serene sight greeted Jose Mourinho and Co as they pulled into the London Stadium.
No baying mob, no bared teeth, not even a hint of a half-full Carlsberg 330ml fizzing through the back window.
In fact, there was barely a supporter of either persuasion in sight.
It would have helped that United managed to get to east London on time, which as we all know has become something of an issue in recent months.

What a surprise it was, then, when Slaven Bilic executed a near-perfect first arabesque midway through the opening period at the London Stadium.
Sure, he's no Nureyev but does the big Croatian have a secret past in the Swan Lake troupe?

DE GEA'S MILESTONE
It seems ridiculous to think that, once upon a time, David de Gea's qualities as a goalkeeper in the Premier League sat beneath some pretty large question marks.
This appearance was the Spaniard's 250th appearance for United and, as ever, he was his side's Mr Reliable.
De Gea has come to the rescue more often than the Thunderbirds during his half-decade at Old Trafford and, even with his team playing against 10 men on Monday, he had to be alert throughout.
An early save from Dimitri Payet, another just before the break to deny Manuel Lanzini and then a superb stop from Michail Antonio gave United the foundation for a crucial win.

THE HURDLING FAN
It's not that long ago that the greatest names in athletics were going for gold inside what is now West Ham's home, and the spirit of the Olympics returned on Monday as a United fan competed in his own version of the 110m hurdles.
Compelled to join his heroes on the pitch after Juan Mata put the visitors in front just after the hour mark, the unidentified supporter - dressed all in black - leapt clear of two flights of advertising hoardings to get onto the pitch, briefly celebrated with Mata and leapt back over the boards and into the stands.
The helpless/hapless stewards (delete as applicable) were left to aimlessly search for him in the away end.

High feet? Jumping in? Studs up? Out of control?
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I mean, let's face it, it looks like Cheikhou Kouyate is launching himself down the Jetstream Fast Flume at Butlin's.

Apparently not.

MIKE DEAN AND TWITTER... AGAIN
You have to wonder whether Mr Dean is in fact powered by internet memes and if, after a hard afternoon's toil, he settles down on the sofa, plugs himself into his Safari browser and powers up on the latest batch of deprecating GIFs.
The official, who seems to be on a constant audition for his local am-dram's version of Othello, fed the online forums once again on Monday with his decision to dismiss Sofiane Feghouli for a late-but-not-particularly-reckless challenge on Phil Jones after 15 minutes.
It was the fastest red card in the Premier League this season and sparked a tried-and-tested backlash on social media.",0.9774872660636902,0,1
"...for missing the significance of the result. The match, held at Old Trafford, saw United dominate possession and create numerous chances, but it was a red card for West Ham's defender, which shifted the momentum decisively in favor of the home side. 

Bruno Fernandes opened the scoring with a well-placed penalty after a foul in the box, and shortly after, Marcus Rashford doubled the lead with a stunning strike from outside the area. West Ham struggled to cope with United's attacking prowess, and despite a spirited effort, they failed to find the back of the net.

As the match progressed, United's defense held firm, showcasing their improved organization under the new management. The victory not only boosts United's confidence but also solidifies their position in the top four, as they aim for Champions League qualification. Fans left the stadium buzzing, hopeful that this winning streak could signal a return to the club's former glory.",0.69448322057724,1,1
"iPhone manufacturers' slowing sales are a bad omen for Apple

Investors hunting for clues to the iPhone X’s reception can take a deeper look at its main manufacturing partners. And the latest doesn’t look good.
Apple Inc.’s five largest device assemblers reported a sharp slowdown after peaking at the end of last year, suggesting demand for the high-end device may have faded just a quarter after its release.
While Hai Precision Industry Co., Pegatron Corp. and three other key suppliers reported an 8 percent rise in their total sales across the March quarter, growth cratered later in the period -- a drop that in the past has presaged a downturn for Apple.
The concern is that the iPhone X, while enjoying a customary holiday quarter spike for new-generation Apple gadgets, fizzled out rapidly. Apple’s costliest smartphone has struggled to draw customers in emerging markets, while competitors from Huawei to Xiaomi roll out more premium phones and dominate China -- the U.S. company’s biggest foreign market. On Friday, Morgan Stanley cut its estimate on iPhone shipments by 6 million, underscoring the growing unease since Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the maker of iPhone processors, issued a disappointing outlook that triggered a 7 percent loss in Apple’s value over the past three days.

Upcoming: Apple might have a new iPhone SE in the works
Apple’s sales growth bears close correlation with that of its main quintet of assemblers, which depend on the iPhone maker for their own business growth -- Hon Hai alone gets about half its revenue from Cupertino. While it’s difficult to translate their numbers directly into Apple’s, a look at reported figures since 2016 suggests it’s possible to draw certain conclusions at the general health of the U.S. smartphone titan’s top-line.
The group is responsible for finishing most of Apple’s gizmos: Hon Hai, Pegatron and Wistron Corp. assemble iPhones. Hon Hai also has a role in other Apple products, splitting MacBooks with Quanta Computer Inc. and sharing iPads with Compal Electronics Inc. Quanta and Compal also make Apple Watches.

Hon Hai and crew can indeed offer insights into Apple’s sales but to a limited extent, said Jusy Hong, a director with IHS Markit. While Hon Hai, Quanta and Pegatron both rely on Cupertino for more than half their business, Wistron and Compal are far less dependent on Apple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In addition, as hardware mavens, their operations would have no impact on sales of software and services, a significant and growing part of Apple’s top and bottom line.
“It’s true that they are major assemblers of Apple but at the same time they have other customers,” he said in an email.
Sour tune: Apple HomePod disappoints with slow sales
Investors remain concerned that iPhone sales at Apple, which reports results May 1, failed to meet their lofty expectations. Mia Huang, an analyst at Taipei-based research firm Trendforce, estimates that overall iPhone production volumes grew slightly to 54-56 million units in the March quarter -- barely up from 52 million in the same period of last year, when it was propelled by demand for lower-priced and older models like the iPhone 6S and ramp up of the iPhone 7.
“According to our estimates, iPhone X’s production volume fell by 50% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter,” said Huang.
AMS AG -- which makes the optical sensors that control brightness and color -- became the latest Apple-supplier to cast doubt over the gadget’s reception. Its shares tumbled after warning on negative operating margins because of low production capacity at its Singapore factories, which Baader Helvea AG analyst Guenther Hollfelder said suggested lower iPhone X volumes than anticipated.
Still, the iPhone X’s higher price tag ensured a tidy jump in revenue. For now, analysts are still counting on the first three months this year to have been Apple’s best second quarter ever with an average estimate for $61 billion in revenue. And while its assembly quintet saw sales decelerate during the period, their collective growth is still double that of a year earlier.

"...has been a flagship product for the company, but recent reports indicate that demand is waning. Analysts suggest that the saturation of the smartphone market, coupled with economic uncertainties, is leading to a decline in iPhone sales. This trend raises concerns about Apple's ability to maintain its revenue growth, as the iPhone accounts for a significant portion of the company's overall income.

In response to these challenges, Apple has been diversifying its product lineup and investing in services such as Apple Music and Apple TV+. However, the reliance on iPhone sales remains a critical factor for the company's financial health. Industry experts are closely monitoring the upcoming product launches and pricing strategies, as they could play a pivotal role in revitalizing interest in the iPhone. If sales continue to decline, it may prompt Apple to rethink its approach to innovation and market positioning in an increasingly competitive landscape.",0.5920624732971191,1,1
"MUMBAI: State Bank of India SBI ) has reduced its staff headcount by 6,622 in the first quarter of FY18 to 2.73 lakh from 2.80 lakh at the beginning of the quarter due to retirements and a voluntary retirement scheme . The bank now plans to redeploy over 10,000 employees following the merger of its associate banks and due to digitisation.Consolidation of associate banks and a shift to digital channels for banking have set in motion a job restructuring process in one of the largest employers in the country. ""While the physics of the merger is over, the chemistry is yet to be completed,"" said Arundhati Bhattacharya , chairman, SBI, referring to the integration process after the merger of balance sheet which came into effect from the first quarter.A large part of the job restructuring is taking place on account of merger as the bank juggles its branch network to avoid having several outlets on the same street. SBI has merged 594 branches till August 6 and has rationalised 122 administrative offices. This in itself is expected to result in savings of over Rs 1,160 crore annually. The bank has entrusted a new entity—SBI Infra Management—the responsibility of managing its real estate assets.SBI is also finding the need to rationalise due to digitisation within and outside the bank. For instance, the bank is redeploying staff in government service branches as the Centre is shifting most of its banking operations to portals. Private lenders like HDFC Bank have been reducing their headcount at a much higher pace even as they push digital transaction. HDFC Bank's staff strength has come down from 90,421 in December 2016 to 84,325 in March 2017.In the first quarter of the current fiscal, the bank saw 7,247 employees exiting following retirements, including 3,569 employees of the erstwhile associate banks who were offered a voluntary retirement scheme. The bank had paid out Rs 473 crore ex gratia under this scheme which will result in salary savings of Rs 400 crore per annum. Of the staff redeployment planned by SBI, 2,000 will be because of shifting of administrative offices and another 8,618 due to branch rationalisation. Around 30% of the staff of rationalised branches will be redeployed in sales functions. The bank has introduced a new employee appraisal system where performers will receive financial incentives.The total employees of SBI and associates as on March 31 was around 2.80 lakh. The number has been stagnant for a couple of years as there has been a hump in retirements of large number of employees hired during the '80s. As against the exits, the bank has hired only 625 staff members in the first quarter, taking the total headcount down to 2,73,181. The number could further drop as full year retirements in FY18 are expected to be around 15,460. The bank is recruiting specialists for digital space and marketing though not in large numbers.The share of alternative (non-branch) channels in transactions has increased substantially from 76% a year ago to 80% on June 2017. The share of internet banking has increased from 24% to 30% of all transactions. Interestingly, ATM transactions are only 34% of transactions as against 43% a year ago.",0.987101674079895,0,1
"...the fiscal year. This reduction is part of the bank's ongoing efforts to streamline operations and improve efficiency in a challenging economic environment. The decrease in workforce comes as SBI aims to leverage technology and digital banking solutions to enhance customer service and reduce operational costs.

The bank has been focusing on automation and digitalization, which has led to a shift in the skill sets required for its workforce. As a result, SBI is investing in training programs to upskill existing employees and prepare them for new roles in a more technology-driven banking landscape.

Despite the reduction in headcount, SBI reported a growth in its net profit for the quarter, driven by an increase in net interest income and a decline in bad loans. The bank remains optimistic about its future growth prospects, emphasizing its commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet while adapting to the evolving banking sector.",0.6241806149482727,1,1

There were positives to be gleaned from the show. Jim Ross was excellent on commentary, while some of the British talents on show looked perfectly acceptable.
ITV made the whole presentation look incredible from a production standpoint, but too many camera cuts ruined the flow and drama.
1.25 million people watched the two hour show, but it remains to be seen whether those ratings have created enough buzz for a full series, or whether the team will have to rely on Alan Partridge esque begs for more episodes.

"with some praising the nostalgic revival of a beloved sport, while others criticized the production quality and pacing. Fans of the original World of Sport Wrestling, which aired from the 1960s to the 1980s, were excited to see familiar faces and classic wrestling styles, but some felt that the new format struggled to capture the essence of its predecessor.

The show featured a mix of established stars and up-and-coming talent, showcasing a variety of wrestling styles that appealed to both old-school fans and a new generation. However, the lack of a cohesive storyline and character development left some viewers wanting more. 

Despite the mixed reviews, the broadcast marked a significant moment for British wrestling, reigniting interest in the sport and prompting discussions about its future on television.

Episode Eighteen | Two Practical Ways to Show and Share the Love of Jesus with Others
Wes Holland, Program Administrator of the Rural Matters Institute at the Billy Graham Center, reminds us that God went on a rescue mission for us, and that we must do the same for others. He shares two challenges that will help us truly serve God. These two simple steps – being present instead of just occupying space and writing down our gospel moments in order to share them with others – can make all the difference in seeing those around us come to faith.
Episode Seventeen | When It Seems as Though God Is Up to Nothing
Laurie Nichols, Director of Communications at the Billy Graham Center, reminds us that even when we don’t see God working, He is. And if we remain faithful in prayer and seek ways to reach out to those who don’t yet know the love of God, He will open doors.
Stay the course, friends. Your work is not in vain (Heb. 6:10). Keep working as though it all depends on you (Col. 3:23), and keeping praying as though it all depends on God (Eph. 6:18).
Episode Sixteen | Are Our Gospel Conversations Only Empty Words?
Kerilee Van Schooten, Church Evangelism Research and Ministries Coordinator at the Billy Graham Center, reminds us that our evangelism must be authentic and real, or people will know it. When others sense we care for them, their hearts soften to the good news we are seeking to share. We must also be ready for how others will respond, even if it’s difficult to hear.
Episode Fifteen | How to Get Into a Gospel Conversation
Jerry Root, Evangelism Professor and Director of the Evangelism Initiative at the Billy Graham Center, discusses how we can get into gospel conversations easily and winsomely. These practical how-tos cover the desire to be loved by God and an understanding that we are all messed up. Talking to people about the love and forgiveness of God is natural and isn’t as hard as we think.
Episode Fourteen | Paying It Forward – The Christian Way
Karen Swanson, Director of the Institute for Prison Ministries at the Billy Graham Center, talks about acts of kindness and how the concept of ‘paying it forward’ can be used as part of our evangelism strategy. Our acts of service, when combined with our gospel proclamation, make a very powerful witness.
Episode Thirteen | Listening: The Beginning of Love
Christina Walker, Associate Director of Academic Programs at the Billy Graham Center, discusses Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s Life Together and the first service we owe to others. We must begin with listening to others. In the cacophony of noise, will we be the kind of people who will truly love others best by actually getting to know them? When we talk with non-Christians, our first step might just be closing our mouths.
Episode Twelve | Inconvenient Evangelism Moments
John Richards, Managing Director of the Billy Graham Center, discusses inconvenient evangelism moments and how we can begin to step into them in order to see God change lives. John uses personal examples to encourage us to actually pray for ‘inconvenient’ moments for the furtherance of the gospel and the potential of changed lives. We must remember that one moment can impact someone’s eternity.
Episode Eleven | Why Do Words Matter?
Ed Stetzer, Executive Director of the Billy Graham Center, discusses the intersection of showing AND sharing the love of Jesus. Why did Jesus come, and how do we hold in tension serving others and proclaiming Christ to others? The gospel isn’t something we do; it’s something Jesus did. How are we responding?

"NEW YORK The U.S. stock market rallied sharply in the wake of President Donald Trump's election on Nov. 8, fueled by the hopes for his agenda of cutting taxes, spending on infrastructure and reducing regulations.
But since he took office, the road toward enacting these proposals has proved bumpy, and several of the early stock winners have faded.
Here is a look at four ""Trump trades"" and how they have fared since his election and since his inauguration.

Inauguration to present: +4.1 percent
President Trump's election sent shivers through investors in hospital operators because of his vow to immediately repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which benefited hospitals by expanding insurance coverage.
But passing healthcare legislation has proved to be not so straightforward even though Trump's fellow Republicans control both chambers of Congress - which has helped the stocks recover. Republicans in the House of Representatives had to pull their first attempt at a bill in late March in a surprising setback for Trump.
The effort seemed to gain fresh momentum on Wednesday as a reworked version won key support from the conservative House Freedom Caucus, with hospital stocks falling after the news, but congressional aides said Thursday that House leaders decided against holding a vote on the healthcare overhaul this week.

Trump's vow to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure helped lead to a windfall for many investors in industries such as construction, engineering, building materials and steel in the immediate aftermath of the election.
Trump has maintained strong support for an infrastructure package, including earlier this month saying his overhaul could top $1 trillion on roads, tunnels and bridges, while promising to cut red tape to speed approval of infrastructure projects. But performance of the stocks has leveled off as an infrastructure package has not yet materialized, while there are indications that putting such a massive program to work could be easier said than done.

Perhaps no sector benefited as much from President Trump's election as banking in the immediate aftermath of his win. Optimism over his ability to roll back regulations boosted the group. Expectations that his agenda would stimulate the economy, promoting inflation and higher interest rates, also energized investors in banking stocks.
But after the stocks' big run, concerns about slowing loan growth have emerged for banks. Trump has pledged to roll back regulations and reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, but his struggle so far in Congress left doubts about whether he can push through such deregulation.
Even though former Goldman Sachs executives populate his administration, Trump himself has been a bit of a wild card for banks, including recent comments that he would like to see interest rates stay low.
TAX CUTS

Trump's plan to cut taxes broadly and reform the tax code gave investors reason to be optimistic about U.S. equities after his election, particularly investing in smaller companies that tend to be more domestically focused.
The promise of tax cuts is still driving the market, which has surged to near records in recent days as Trump was primed to propose slashing the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent. But Trump's struggle in his first legislative effort - repealing Obamacare - has sowed doubts about his ability to enact his plans.
Since Trump started in office, investors have also expressed concerns that his involvement in international issues in Syria, North Korea and elsewhere would distract from his domestic agenda.

"and deregulation. Investors were optimistic that Trump's policies would stimulate economic growth and lead to higher corporate profits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged over 1,000 points in the days following the election, marking one of the most significant post-election rallies in history.

Financial and industrial stocks led the charge, with banks benefiting from expectations of higher interest rates and reduced regulations. Additionally, the energy sector saw gains as Trump’s administration signaled support for fossil fuel production and infrastructure projects. 

However, analysts cautioned that the market's rapid ascent could lead to volatility, especially if Trump's policies faced significant hurdles in Congress. Concerns over trade policies and potential geopolitical tensions also loomed, prompting some investors to remain cautious. As the transition period unfolded, market participants closely monitored cabinet appointments and legislative proposals, eager to gauge the potential impact on the economy and stock market trajectory in the months ahead.",0.6197788715362549,1,1
"LIMERICK U-21 hurling manager Pat Donnelly and selectors Brian Foley, Maurice O’Brien and Mikey Kiely have released a 26-man for Saturday’s All Ireland U-21 hurling semi final.
The starting 15 will be confirmed on Thursday evening.
Seamus Flanagan and Josh Adams are additions to the 24 players that were togged out for the Munster final win over Cork. Flanagan is yet to get game-time this season but is one of 14 members of the Limerick panel that hold an All Ireland U-21 medal from 2015.
Limerick, who are 4/5 favourites for the All Ireland title, have used 23 different players in their three games to-date.
The star-studded Limerick panel are Thurles bound for the All Ireland semi final meeting with Galway. The game in Semple Stadium has a 6.00 start, while Kilkenny play Derry in the other semi final at 4.00 – both live on TG4.
While Limerick have beaten Tipperary, Clare and Cork enroute to winning the Munster title, Saturday will be Galway’s first U-21 game of the season.
But Galway hurling is riding a crest of a wave at present with their senior and minor teams already into September 3 All Ireland finals.
The Tribesmen U-21s are managed by Tony Ward.

Limerick can call upon seven players that played senior inter-county championship this Summer.
Three years ago at minor level, Limerick were 1-27 to 2-9 winners over Galway in the All Ireland MHC semi final and the bookies make the Shannonsiders the 1/6 favourites to repeat that victory and reach the September 9 final in Thurles. Galway did however win the All Ireland minor title in 2015.
Saturday will be the eighth meeting of Limerick and Galway at U-21 level – Limerick have five victories, including the last meeting in 2015. Six of that Limerick team will most likely once again start – Sean Finn, Ronan Lynch, Cian Lynch, Colin Ryan, Barry Nash and captain Tom Morrissey.
PANEL: Josh Adams (Ballybrown), Paudie Ahern (Killeedy), Conor Boylan (Na Piarsaigh), Peter Casey (Na Piarsaigh), Andrew La Touche Cosgrave (Monaleen), Daragh Fanning (Pallasgreen), Sean Finn (Bruff), Seamus Flanagan (Feohanagh), Aaron Gillane (Patrickswell), Thomas Grimes (Na Piarsaigh), Robbie Hanley (Kilmallock), Kyle Hayes (Kildimo-Pallaskenry), Cian Hedderman (Ballybrown), Dan Joy (Kilmallock), Lorcan Lyons (Monaleen), Cian Lynch (Patrickswell), Ronan Lynch (Na Piarsaigh), Mike Mackey (Adare), Eoghan McNamara (Doon), Conor McSweeney (South Liberties), Tom Morrissey (Ahane), Barry Murphy (Doon), Barry Nash (South Liberties), Jack O’Grady (Knockainey), Oisin O’Reilly (Kilmallock), Colin Ryan (Pallasgreen).",0.9657477140426636,0,1
"...features a blend of experienced players and promising young talent, showcasing the depth of Limerick's hurling program. Key players to watch include captain and midfielder John O’Neill, whose leadership on the field has been instrumental throughout the campaign.

In defense, the team will rely on the solid performances of full-back Tomás O’Reilly, who has consistently thwarted opposing attacks. The management team expressed confidence in their squad, emphasizing the importance of teamwork and resilience as they prepare to face a formidable opponent in the semi-final.

Donnelly stated, “We’ve worked hard to get to this stage, and the players are ready to give their all. We know it will be a tough challenge, but we believe in our game plan and the talent we have.” The match is set to draw a large crowd, with fans eager to support the team in their quest for All-Ireland glory.",0.74210524559021,1,1
